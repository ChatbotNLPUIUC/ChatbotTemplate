Question,Answer
Python?,"There is no course that will teach you python. As an ECE major you just learn C (from 220), C++ (from 225) and x86 (from 391). Python is possibly the easiest language to learn. Just understand oop properly from CS 225 and then you can learn any language by looking up it's syntax. Some courses like CS 440 may force you to learn the language yourself as all the mps are in python (but they don't teach you the language)"

asking profs to bypass prereqs,"Proficiency tests for three main into cs courses exist for 125,173,225. Ngl I could have done these but it was a combination of laziness and imposter syndrome that led me not to. I ended up working for 125 for quite some time so I guess it was worth it though but the professor asked me on several occasions why I didn't proficiency out."
