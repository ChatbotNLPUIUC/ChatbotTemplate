Question,Answer
"If we have the armory to store all our arms, where is the leggory for storing our legs?","Leggory hall, the building at wright and armory"
I disappointed my grandmom and spent the money that she gave me on Webassign instead of a shit ton of candy,"No but you can still redeem yourself. Get corn from the morrow plots and sacrifice a squirrel to the chancellor and your soul will be saved 

(Pls dont actually hurt the squirrel, I dont condone the harming of any animal in any ritual)"
Is it normal to feel like you can’t keep going when you first start college?,"College is really hard, especially right now. Online classes are confusing, and there's not many social events, but it isn't a reason to quit. One thing that's really helped me is an assignment notebook. I write down every single assignment and it's due date, so even though I might forget, when I look in my notebook it's there. A lot of people are in your boat right now, I get it, it feels like shit, but one thing to remember is that everything is temporary, and this will blow over soon."
What accounts for 67% but also 95%,For a moment I thought this was about standard deviations
Why do students have to pay Webassign just to do homework? Is there a way to petition the math department to change this?,https://images.app.goo.gl/3N7W4JccQaUuMPUr9
Anyone else getting overwhelmed with having 49293 different websites for everything?,[This comes to mind](https://xkcd.com/927/)
Hi can someone tell me everything will be ok,You got this! We’re almost at the finish line - keep your head up and keep grinding. One productivity tip that helps me is to write down a weekly to-do list of all my assignments for each of my classes and then prioritize them and see which ones need to get done first
What are some underrated things we can get for free as UIUC students?,Covid testing.
How exactly do frats and Greek life work?,"Social fraternities are organizations for men, they are oftentimes named with Greek letters. Each organization has its own values and personality, but the ultimate goal of any frat is to provide a place for likeminded men to socialize and build connections. A lot of the time, fraternities have houses members can live together in.

At the start of each semester, fraternities will try to build their membership numbers by holding events for men that are interested in joining an organization. These are called rush events, and they vary based on the chapter that hosts them. These events let current members (actives) meet potential new members (PNMs)"
Raw Vegetables,Ik it costs more money but maybe head to county and pick some up. I did that my freshman year
I need tips on how to survive in UIUC,"If you're on campus, the dining app is useful for meals.

There is a moodle app that I use for classes with moodle.

Google calendar is your friend. If you want to have your classes on calendar with the most accurate info, download the .ics file of your schedule from Self Service > Registration and records > Enhanced registration > view class schedules > select your semester > click on the email looking icon near your schedule to email the .ics file to yourself. You can then import that ics file into Google calendar very easily (can Google and find out) 

But the best way to stay on top of your assignments is to check all the websites everyday. There's no way I can forget about a deadline if I'm worried enough about it. But if it's a recurring deadline or you normally forget deadlines, add a reminder on Google calendar."
Where can we study?,"If I knew, what makes you think I would share my secret? ;) But to be serious, I would recommend taking a bus to downtown Champaign. Tons of coffee shops there with outdoor (and some indoor) seating where you can sit and do some work. Just make sure to bring a mask and try to buy a coffee to support their business."
Exhausted,"Re: the safety of outside walks, I'd maybe call up the friendly officers at UIUC (nonemergency number) and ask for recommendations on keeping safe at night.

Not sure what part of campus you are at, but perhaps the officers know about crimes in that area.

I think that you are doing the right thing by going for a walk.  Best therapy; used by many a scientist to clear their head.  And best of luck in your goals, its gotta be rough.  But hopefully you're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel that we're all in."
Is being an RA worth it?,"from a financial aspect - no. just get a part time job. the main perk is free room and board - but you end up hating your room and board. just get a part time job, live in a cheaper apartment, and you can easily pay for it. 

now, if you actually think being an RA is cool, do it. but yeah its a lot of responsibility and stress that a 20 yo should not have to deal with (whether its underage drinkers to suicide watch to sexual assault. not fun). if the challenge of that excites you, work, we need RAs like you. if not, then no"
Who is responsible for these brilliant memes??,"Everyone on this sub except for you is Chancellor Jones, but with thousands of alt accounts. 

Sometimes an account is even Tim Killeen."
"Heya, I have this massive crush on the girl who lives in the house next to me. I am so shy, so it’s hard for me to show my feelings without being jokey.","Wha- me?

There’s Absolutely Nowhere to Sit?,"Yeah they opened up a LOT of classrooms for this purpose just walk into a building, walk into an open classroom that's empty or near empty and you can study"
Easy second 8 week gen eds courses recommendations,I think they're offering an 8 week version of the personal finance class I'm taking rn. It's super easy and the information you learn is very helpful. The course is ACE 240 section ELE and it'll look at the same things in the 16 week class but within the context of the upcoming election. Craig is also a great professor and lecturer so you're in for a treat!
Freshman failing half my classes not sure what to do,"My biggest piece of advice is to just take a few minutes and calm down. Watch a YouTube video or something that you enjoy to take your mind off of school. This has been a stressful semester so do not feel alone or upset. I cannot imagine having to come into college as a freshman and having everything be online. Cut yourself some slack as what matters now is you learned your lesson and now know how to approach college courses.

You need to see if dropping these courses will put you below the credits needed to be a full-time student, if it does you really need to talk to your advisor about doing that and if you can. At the end of the day, it is up to you if you want to drop. I recommend seeing how you feel after studying for both finals over the next few days. Most courses drop their load off around this time so I would just try to crank a lot of practice problems and studying out. If you feel as if one is too out of reach, then see if you can drop. Most importantly, come out of this having learned a valuable lesson and calmed down. If you are stressed and anxious you will only hurt yourself, so have some fun and relax a little. College is not only about grades. You will be able to do better in the upcoming semesters, you will graduate, and you will get a job doing something you are passionate about. You got this!!"
No Freshman Information/Orientation,"Probably not the answer you want to hear, but you have to look a lot of these things up yourself. Google “UIUC freshmen welcome week” or search it on this subreddit. No one is going to hold your hand in college and guide you through everything that’s going on. The one exception is that your RA should be holding a floor meeting sometime this weekend to go over some info on the dorms."
Swiping I-Card Tips?,"Don’t be embarrassed, it happens to literally everyone. Sometimes if you wipe the card on your shirt or pants it will go through better, but the readers just aren’t sensitive."
Loud neighbors in dorm,You can call the front desk while the RA is asleep. There is always an on-duty RA available to respond to these types of calls. You need to keep calling so the situation continues to be documented (and stopped).
Zoom lectures/discussions suck,"As a TA, we know how much it sucks. This is not how in person courses go at all and it sucks that this is your first college experience.

Edit: I want to add, don't forget that your TA's and instructors are human too. We're also going through this pandemic. We are doing our best but we're also in this shitty situation."
Measly freshman kinda lost,"Most friend groups this early on in freshmen year stem just from graduating from the same high school, which gets old for many students very quickly. Those students will look for people to hang out with."
Did I make a mistake(seeking advice),"I also have a sense of regret... but to be completely honest, at least for me, going and HOPING that parties, large gatherings, and other shit like that won’t happen and having my room and board money on the line of said hope isn’t worth it. This is just me. I stayed home cause being sent home after a month or less and getting little to no money back would really piss me off... if the semester goes smoothly with kids in their dorm rooms, I’ll definitely regret not going, but it’s definitely a gamble in my opinion."
Anybody know what’s happening on the quad right now?,I heard him shout the person he loved went and fucked someone else so he’s having a terrible day it seems
When to get apartment,"You can sign a lease right now for your sophmore year actually. I would start looking now if you know who your roommates would be. However, don't be afraid to be patient up through even May if you need time to look through options or find roommates. It would probably be wise to at least be on campus in Spring before you finalized anything so that you have an idea of how far the apartment really is from the quad and other uni buildings that will hopefully be open in your sophmore year. Being on campus would also allow you to schedule apartment tours, which tbh should definitely be a requirement for yourself before signing a lease; sometimes the pictures give the wrong idea of the place"
Any advice for a freshman trying to make friends with the pandemic going on?,"honestly, transitioning to making friends in college is more difficult than in HS in general, because there's a little more effort needed to maintain contact with that person (won't always run into that person). the two best ways to make friends, covid or not, is in class and in RSOs so being involved with the people in those group chats and Zooms will prove to be ever more useful."

Any open gyms beside Arc?,Anytime fitness and crunch fitness are both gyms that a number of students go to.  There’s also smaller niche gyms around as well
im going bonkers !,"im in the same situation! whether or not u go is ultimately up to u, but i decided to stay home. ik it sucks ass to feel like ur missing out, but i dont think missing a semester will be that big a deal in the scheme of 4 years. there will probably be a big enough group of people that did the same thing, so maybe therell be another set of events for us. plus people on campus still arent getting the full college experience with all the restrictions in place. PLUS im saving that housing shmoney and can rest assured that im less likely to get covid. i can control whether or not i socially distance, but i cant control what other ppl on campus do (although the testing 2x a week is impressive). 

just letting u know ur not alone and everything will be okay no matter what you decide :)"
How is Quad Day 2020 woking?,"Taken from another thread I commented in, but:

I am president of an RSO, a lot of us thought they would be sending out a massmail telling people about the event but I emailed them and they said the were only letting incoming freshman know for some reason... If there are any clubs you're interested in the event is 12-4pm CST and you can find the relevant zoom/conferencing link on their specific club page! I can't see the same view as a regular person, but I assume you can see each individual club and click their links, no?

How can I get involved with music on campus?!,I don't k know about official on campus stuff. You might check out C4A in Urbana. Community Center for the Arts. I don't know what the have going on at the moment but the have had programs for all ages.
How do I make friends as a remote freshman?,"im gonna keep it real with you chief- you don’t. As a remote student it’s almost impossible. Nobody wants to say it but that’s the reality of the situation. 

If you decide to come to campus second semester or next year there will be plenty of people in the same boat as you, so don’t think you’re going to be the odd one out without a friend group."
Grades,"no centralized location unfortunately. it isn’t even required for professors to input grades before finals, so unfortunately plenty don’t and there’s no way to know your grade"

What's a not time consuming US Minority Gen Ed?,"I am in a similar situation and planning on taking AFRO 228. Its about hip hop music and has a 3.78 average gpa. With an average gpa this high, I would assume its an easy A but i personally don't know anyone who has taken the class."
"LAS 100: Oh, here's another required LAS course for incoming overpaying international students to waste their time",If you can't get out of it ask your advisor to do a credit overload it's probably a blow-off course anyways.
I did something really dumb in cs 125 and need to know how worried I should be,"You'll be fine.

Also if that qualifies as ""really dumb"" for you then I'm impressed!"
Policy on Overloading during Spring Sem for Freshmen,"If you're trying to graduate in 3 years, don't torture yourself. Take winter/summer courses instead and the overall cost will still be m u c h cheaper than if you graduate in 4 years.

Edit: to answer your question, whether you can overload in the spring depends on your GPA this semester."
What are some clubs to join remotely?,[deleted]
Free Office 365 messes up computer,By any chance while installing the products did you leave the “Allow organization to manage my device” checked or something similar? Is this a personal laptop or one loaned out by the university?
Freshman Social Situation,"Tbh I think a lot of people are in the same boat as you but luckily you live in a dorm with a ton of other people! I recommend talking to your RA, going to hall events, and maybe joining any organizations in your hall like hall council"
Do I need to pay the health insurance fee (listed in my campus fees) as an incoming international student who is staying in their home country?,"No you don’t. You just need to provide proof of insurance/healthcare to opt out. Also if your country provides you with free/universal healthcare, then you can just provide proof of that. A list of healthcare benefits provided by your government would suffice. I’ve opted out of uiuc’s health insurance for this summer term.

Edit: When you fill out the healthcare waiver on united health care's website and it asks for United States specific information such as a US Healthcare provider, just fill out n/a or not available. Then email the student health insurance office about your situation. They will ask you to send an email back with proof of insurance."
Is the Counseling Center nice and worth it?,"I think it is, I got an appointment with a counselor for an hour after I called (during the middle of the day, too) and she was really helpful. I don't think it's a replacement for long-term therapy but like especially for school-related stress and giving you resources for that, I think it's a great resource. They do one-on-one meetings for a short period of time and also have group therapy. And if you need something more long-term they're pretty good about helping you find a therapist in the area."
Memorial Stadium open?,I’ve done workouts up the ramps or bleachers hundreds of times over the years. I’m not sure if the gates are locked this year or not but during the day they are almost always open and no one really cares if you’re in there if you aren’t being a dick
Is it sus to only shoot for an F on my final?,"Some people (including freshman/sophomore year me) will say that your attitude as a student is awful and you need to give everything your best, but honestly if you feel that you will not have regrets afterwards about not trying hard enough, who cares... Nobody should besides yourself."
idk if i made the right decision,[deleted]
Is it worth going on campus next semester as a freshman?,Stay home. UIUC feels dead atm
What did you wish you knew about the counseling center + getting DRES accommodations when you were a freshman,For the counseling center - thats its not a long process that involves you going to mckinly to set up an appointment. all u need to do is call.

Math Major,"If you want to teach high school math, it's perfectly ok to just squeeze by and survive your upper level math classes. You'll never use the stuff again. If you have a good handle of algebra and geometry, and you like working with kids, you can be a great high school math teacher, even if you got a C in 400 level math classes."
"Wanting to minor in CS, should I take CS 125 next semester ?","We do offer a [proficiency exam](https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/) for CS 125 to well-prepared students. You could take it next semester, although at this point you're too late to take it and proceed to CS 173 in the spring. I don't think that it replaces the experience of taking the course, but it's a reasonable thing to do if you already have quite a bit of programming experience.

CS 125 covers quite a bit more than AP CS A typically covers. But the quality of AP CS courses varies, and some cover much more than is required to pass the exam.

We've been working hard since March to migrate CS 125 to an asynchronous online format, including exclusive new systems for online daily lessons, interactive examples and walkthroughs, homework, quizzes, and support. Most of this is accessible to you on [the course website](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/).

I think that the format is working particularly well during the pandemic, but there are also aspects that we'll continue even once we're in person again. While standing on the stage of Foellinger is a huge thrill, I don't plan to resume lecturing. But we will resume in-person office hours (for social reasons) and return exams to the CBTF (for security reasons).

One other thing to keep in mind is that CS 125 will undergo some significant changes beginning in Fall 2021 as part of an incoming multi-course CS curriculum revision. It will drop from 4 credit hours to 3, be renumbered, and there may be other important changes as well which I can't divulge quite yet. I think it will be even more fantastic and exciting. It will definitely be different. So this spring represents your last chance to take it in its current format."
Virtual karate,lol what?
ICEE Machine,There’s an ICEE machine at the Subway that’s in the walmart in Urbana!

Is it cheaper to buy all your groceries from county or use a delivery service for walmart,Aldi. Always Aldi. County is stupid expensive.
Will dorm prices remain the same?,You’ll likely end up either being prorated (paid back the two week’s worth) or just not charged in the first place for those weeks. I would ask housing.
does the counseling center deal with ptsd?,"If you want to seek counseling for it, yes. However, therapy sessions are limited. They will help you find group therapy or therapist outside of school"
"Calculus 2, UIUC or Community College?","I took both Calc 2 and 3, with Calc 2 being worse for me out of the two. I’d go the CC route (make sure the credit is transferrable) since it’d surely be a lot less hair pulling than here."
pie? please,i’m a freshman too so i don’t know but i hope you find your pie :)
Languages Above 4th Level,I know this is said a lot. But really ask your advisor.
"I understand the whole prestige of coming UIUC and the wide number of opportunities and connections that can bring. But...aside from that, is the teaching any good? The math department? Physics? Chem? MCB?","Honestly, I think it depends on who you have and what class you are taking.From my experience, my professors for physics 211(mechanics) and 212(e&m) were awesome and I learned a lot in those classes and eventually ended with great grades.

For math, I have taken 241(Calc 3), 225(Matrix Theory), and 285(Diffeq). For me, 241 was tough as I could not really understand the material and that is kinda my fault but I got help from the professor directly as well as CARE tutoring. 225  was horrible for me as I think the teacher was questionable. 285  was awesome for me and the teacher made everything understandable and was well taught.

I have not taken a chemistry class here, but I know that Chem 102/104(Chem 1/2) are known as weed out classes and are just generally hard due to the material and possibly the professors that teach them.

I hope this helps, pm me if you want to ask any more specific questions. I am happy to answer."
Python?,"There is no course that will teach you python. As an ECE major you just learn C (from 220), C++ (from 225) and x86 (from 391). Python is possibly the easiest language to learn. Just understand oop properly from CS 225 and then you can learn any language by looking up it's syntax. Some courses like CS 440 may force you to learn the language yourself as all the mps are in python (but they don't teach you the language)"
Lacrosse Wall Ball (where to wall ball?),"I'm not a lax bro but I would guess:

\- Temple Hall (wall facing South Quad)

\- the field house next to the basketball courts near First/Gregory

\- the area between ARC and the new football practice facility"

no roommate :(,I know a ton of people here at PAR in the same situation. You'll def make friends with your floormates and stuff tho!!
UIUC disciplinary update?,[deleted]
Where do I spend my cafe credits?,"In past years, you could spend them at these stores:
1) Penn Station, located in PAR
2) Chomps,  located in ISR
3) 57 North, located in Internet Ikenberry Commons

There are other places and also remember that you can swipe into the dining hall with café credits too, but those are the main places you'd spend them"
Mckinley IUD insurance help,"Did they give you the little flier that gives you instructions on how to submit your claim? If you follow the instructions and print out your statement and send it to the address given, they’ll send you a reimbursement check. It shouldn’t take more than a week or two so you should be able to pay it by the end of the month"
Are both the quad days the same?,To my knowledge yes they are but some RSOs might have only wanted to pick one day to show at
Meal Plan meals disappeared,"The week starts over on Sunday. Meals do not roll over. Cafe credits can roll over, but you cannot have more than 2 weeks worth at a time, so a max of 30 credits in your case. 

I’m not sure why your balance shows 0 today. Perhaps it’s a glitch?"
Entrepreneurship RSOs,There’s a bunch of them. Founders has a diverse group of people from different majors. Entrecorps is nice for getting to know the local startups through consulting projects.
Grade on Compass / Blackboard,"Not entirely sure, but I think it’s an option they can select but it’s difficult when things are of different weights. So most classes have it disabled for that fact. Feel free to calculate it yourself!"

How bad is it getting a C on your transcript freshman year?,"I got a 2.45 my freshman year at UIUC. Made deans list both semesters of my senior year, now getting my M.Eng from the university. Freshman year don't mean shit. but do better."
If you could change one thing about UIUC what would it be and why?,I would make Pokémon real
community college credit,It won't be on your U of I transcript unless you send them an official transcript from the CC. Just don't transfer it and it won't affect your GPA. Also yeah you can still take the proficiency test
COVID TESTING,Was less than 8 hours now it is up to 48. One hopes they get the DB fixed over night and start to get back to under 24.
Business + Premed Advice?,"I don’t have any insights on this, but I was pre-med my freshman year, and I was a biology major. Totally regret it and wish i had started out as a business major or the major i’m in now instead. Business + Pre-med is a much nicer path, because down the road if you decide to change your mind that you don’t wanna do pre-med anymore, you can still do something great with your degree (that won’t necessarily be research or teaching - i know a lot of unhappy ex-pre-med biology grads lol). I have some friends doing Finance + pre-med so it’s definitely doable. You just take your major classes and then fulfill the pre med requirements i think."
What happens if I have to leave campus for a week and have to miss COVID tests?,Just test as soon as you return. You will be unable to enter buildings until results are reported. Check with RA if you live in a dorm.
Why would uiuc only have One class for each course to go online.,"Potentially not. Using coursicle app does help sneak into classes you expect will be full, though"

BioCalc Math 220,"Looks like a neat class on first blush. I've got no more insight than that, but I say go for it if you think it looks interesting."
Bookstore?: Problem with payment using financial aid,"Jim Trail - Operations Manager IUB Sorry that I just saw this. 

The Bookstore is not permitted to directly access your student accounts. It is due to [this law](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1077&ChapterID=18). Not fun reading BTW but want to provide the information.

You will receive a ""refund"" of any amounts over tuition and fees and you are allowed to use those funds for the other cost of attendance. We do have specific options for specialty accounts where a University department is charged for the initial billing or that department has secured a pay it later option for their students. But unless you have access to one of those accounts, you will have to find an alternate form of payment. 

As for your order being cancelled, send me an email at [jmtrail@illinois.edu](mailto:jmtrail@illinois.edu) and I will try to get it held until you can make alternate arrangements."
Are there any video game developement classes?,"If you want to use an engine (Unity, Unreal, etc.), I would recommend finding tutorials online. The popular, high-rated courses on Udemy are definitely worth the $10-15 you can buy them for on sale. You get a pretty good mix of learning game design, how to use the engine, and coding.

If you're planning on building from scratch, probably any programming CS course is going to be helpful (125, 126, 225, 241, etc.), even if they aren't directly related to game design."
How hard is ASTR 100,"Took it last semester 2nd 8 weeks in the middle of covid and I didn’t do any of the readings and just clicked through all the notes, just googled all the hw answers (everything is on quizlet) and got 60s on all the exams and still got an A lmfao"
Onewheel/ Boosted Board,Honestly either would be fine imo. A boosted board might be easier to bring into class (if you even have in person classes) since a one wheel can be bulky
Transportation between Classes Advice,"The bus will get you there, is reliable, and is not going to freeze your ass off in the winter.

If you don’t want to take the bus for certain unnamed virus reasons, it will REALLY depend on location. If it’s main quad that might be possible if you hustle. If it’s engineering quad or transportation building you’ll likely need to study closer to there."
virtual quad day,Yes tomorrow 12-4!
When should I look/lease an apartment for my sophomore year?,"with covid, we really don't know how anything will play out for 2021. i know scary/unrealistic/ unprofitable, but i personally would hold off. lots of students got screwed over trying to sublease this fall bc they signed leases last fall. even if you wait for the spring."
CS 126 Lectures academics,"Yeah to be completely honest, lecture for this class sucks. Maybe go for the start of the semester and see if it works for you, but my friends and I have all stopped attending lecture because the assignments can be done perfectly fine without the lecture. Don't ignore them altogether though because we had one lecture activity earlier where there was a group PrairieLearn assignment.

Once you get to C++, lectures become more important assuming you have no prior knowledge. Still, the knowledge necessary for even the C++ assignments may be easier for you to digest if you research on your own."
Registration questions,"POT classes are fast paced, so I'd say it's different than a quarter of any normal-paced classes. If there is a POT course, then you only have to sign up for one (POT A or POT B)--in that 8-week period, you'll complete materials that are usually 16-weeks long. So expect more work."
How do I drop James Scholars?,"Just don’t do the commitment for your college and you’ll be dropped at the end of the year. So if that’s taking an honors course, just don’t do that and you’ll be dropped.

As for your LAS class, I’m assuming it’s an honors course? Idk if you can switch it to a normal course this far into the semester, I’d see if someone else can chime in on that"
Where do y'all get your computers fixed?,Hey I’m willing to take a look at it for no charge. My rate is just you pay the parts + $10-40 depending on what it is. Dm me and we can see!

Freshman Question: Where is the page with the yellow line on it that indicates which courses you can get deal credit for and which you can't,Someone can correct me if I am wrong but what you are describing does not exist. You are talking about meeting gen-ed requirements for which many courses can knock out multiple requirements (still just counting for usually 3 credit hours). You can search for them using [https://courses.illinois.edu/search/form](https://courses.illinois.edu/search/form)
RSOs - A Tale of an Overwhelmed Freshman,"You won't get in trouble and that's totally okay to do. Attend a meeting or two and see if you like it, and if you don't there's no pressure to go back. It's _really_ common for RSOs to have a bunch of people show up to the first meeting after Quad Day and then most of them never come back. Every RSO is a little different but most of them don't have member dues that you have to pay and most of them have an e-mail newsletter or Facebook group or something to let people know about what they are doing.

Basically, show up to anything that you think you might find fun or interesting and if you don't like it there's no obligation to go back."
dorm question,"No, they don’t come with one. I bought a $12 over-the-door hanging mirror from Target and it worked out great."
When is the ARC weight room least crowded?,never
Coming Out of State,"1. Not an engineering major but I’ve heard through the grapevine it’s challenging but definitely doable if you play your cards right
2.  Not too sure again but I’m positive plenty of firms would salivate at the thought of having a uiuc engineering kid
3. I started as a freshman in 2016 (lol) and came in knowing like 3 other kids. I was able to gel with a group pretty quickly as mostly everyone here is friendly, especially during the first few weeks of freshman year. But a lot of it also depends on how outgoing/ social you are. UIUC is a huge school and it’s a mixed bag of oos and kids who came in with half their graduating class but it’s easy to find your niche if you actually go out and search. Although with corona the friend making dynamic may have slightly shifted from what it once was eons ago when I started 
4. Frats get a bad rap on Reddit but if that’s what you want go for it. UIUC has a large social and professional fraternity scene and all are very active in terms of social gatherings (some more than others). It might not be on Alabama or FSU level but it’s definitely better than most schools. If you do rush just remember to be yourself and have confidence in yourself. Some of the best people I’ve met in my life were through my social fraternity. As long as you demonstrate your ability in yourself you shouldn’t have any problems getting a few bids 
5. UIUC is more of a bar school, but finding a party is pretty easy if you look in the right places. Parties depend on who you know to invite you, although there are a fair share of open invite (but ya gotta pay). 
Dating is a mixed bag, but I’d say (from my experience) you get out what you put in. As long you’re somewhat sociable and not a creep/smell bad/ dress like a slob you’re good. 
6. The CU area has a good amount of internships/jobs on campus, but I’d say a majority of the “lucrative” ones are in Chicago/Indy/St. Louis. UIUC also has tons of research opportunities with professors and the research park for undergraduates."
Has anyone done zoom on the quad?,"It’s pretty good, but it’s better on the edges than the center."
What are some good organizations I should try as freshman? Thx!,Very much depends on what excites you. What have you never done but might like to learn about? Are you interested in service work helping others. Or are you into stocks and trading? Wanna learn to lose money at pocker? Work on bikes? Work in a maker lab? Write short stories. Cook?
Last Content covered in FYCARE,Do you have a hold on your account for registration?
MATH 220 new student proficiency exam,"When I took it last year, iirc the exam had 20 or 25 MC Questions. Nothing too difficult if you know the basic concepts well. Professor Leonard for calculus ( calc. 1 in your case) on youtube will be a very helpful resource throughout college and is always helpful if you want to brush over or learn the concepts.  If you have time, doing practice papers surely won't hurt. Best of luck!"
Adobe Creative Cloud,We have it free for a year for coronavirus. After the year we have to pay the student rate (bleh)
What is a good price for rent?,$270 is insanely low. I can’t imagine what the caveat for that one is.... a reasonable range is usually $400-800 per person per month
I masks,"They hand them out at State Farm Center during centralized check-in, after your COVID test."
Bookstore,Welcome to responsibility
Quiet spaces in/around animal sciences lab?,"Espresso Royale, Caffé Bene, or Caffé Paradiso should be under a 10 minute walk and should have WiFi. If you are really worried about making it, you could always explain the situation to your professors and see if one could let you go early to make your next class. One kid asked my professor to do that, and he was very accommodating."
"So I missed due dates for submitting my applications to some of the organizations, are there anything else I could do to get involve?","Check out Student Run Virtual Quad Day tomorrow (September 6th) 1-4pm.

https://www.facebook.com/events/627288581554419"
To any Grainger engineering students: what laptop do you use?,Dell XPS 13 + Education iPad + Apple Pencil combo. All of them combined cost less than a decent MacBook Pro.
par ice machine??,Next to the Zamboni garage.
"Does UIUC mail admission packages to incoming students? (Stickers, booklets, merchandise etc etc)","I'm an incoming student (in-state) and back in March I got an admission envelope with the admission letter, information (like housing, admitted student checklist, etc.), and just some stickers. I feel like I saw somewhere that they didn't mail those internationally, but I could be wrong."
Drop to part-time & add community college classes?,"I mean yeah, if it saves you money. You’d lose all the fool time student benefits, which I think are in person benefits anyway. I may be wrong, but you MAY lose financial aid for not being full time, but I’d check with the aid office to be safe."
textbook pickup,"https://bookstore.illinois.edu/site_customer_service.asp

I think they send an email, but here is the updated procedure."
When to start looking for an apartment?,"There are a handful of popular apartment buildings on campus that get fully signed in the first few months of school, but the majority of apartment buildings will have rooms available through the spring semester. The best place to start is to figure out what you want. What is your budget?
How many bedrooms/how many roommates?
Would you prefer to live in Champaign or Urbana? 
Are there specific qualities you look, ie newly renovated? 
Once you feel like you know these answers, start looking on sites like apartments.com, where you can narrow apartments down by certain qualities. You can also browse websites of popular campus leasing companies (JSM, CPM, Green St realty, ACC, first column, etc) and find a few apartments that interest you. There isn’t really an “application” per se, usually you have to apply before you sign a lease, but it’s a small thing. Basically you pick an apartment and then sign the lease. Overall, there isn’t a big need to rush, take adequate time to find an apartment that suits your needs. I hope that helps you!"
Does uiuc health insurance include birth control?,"Here’s the link to the Contraceptive Options through McKinley with pricing

https://mckinley.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/docs/Mckinley-Contraception-Formulary%202020-2021%2006.05.20.pdf"
Discord for physics,"There is a server for everything in the Physics Department. It has channels for each physics class and is official. They have already done one event through it.  


[https://discord.gg/KXKUbY](https://discord.gg/KXKUbY)"
Asian Frats on Campus?,"There's Lambdas, CST, and KPiB on campus. You can search up their zoom events on facebook or contact their rush chairs through instagram."
Spring semester schedule opinions,"The Calc series here is a weed out so 241 is always tougher than it should be, Phys 211 is also not super easy (average GPA is a 2.89 for the class), CS126 shouldn’t be awful but there were posts yesterday about CS173 breaking people.

AKA it’ll be tough, but if you put in the work it’s not gonna be impossible"
No I-Card,"illini union, not sure about getting a second one tho"
Places to vote? And can I still register today,Yes you can still register today. I was at the polling place at Oglesby Hall earlier and it wasn’t busy at all
Any tips for improving wifi connection in campus housing?,Idk your budget but maybe try investing in a decent PCIe wifi adapter instead of a usb adapter since PCIe goes directly onto the motherboard which allows for better signal and speed overall.
Package delivery address,"It will most likely get to you, since you got the address right, but normally you’ll want to put the hall and your room number/letter so it’s easier to find who it’s meant to go to!"
Do I have to pay for health insurance if I'm staying at home? + other complaints,"Regardless of location, you should be able to opt of the student health insurance [here](https://studentcenter.uhcsr.com/illinois). The official bill was scheduled to update on September 8th, so that's probably why there was a delay. My part-time status took a couple weeks to update after contacting them, but the Range II tuition reduction didn't show up until today. I also emailed last week about an overcharge on my fees, but still haven't gotten a response on that."
Which businesses organizations should I join as freshman? Kind of overwhelmed with the amount of them😂,"Heya!! Definitely would disagree with the other comment. Business frats, like many many many other organizations, aim to follow certain pillars and emphasize brotherhood/sisterhood/bonding. In reality, you have many options. Business frats are not by any means an end all/be all. Just because you’re in a business fraternity doesn’t mean you’re the shit. And if you go for one and get denied, you’re not a piece of shit. 

I personally didn’t rush a business frat and I don’t feel you have to. You should join RSO’s that you’re passionate about and genuinely like. You should join for the people and community. Personally, I’ve got some friends that COMPLETELY changed after the rush process, including some from my high school. 

Go by interest category and check out business quad day happening on gies groups. If you’re interested in majoring in accounting and are looking for a good way to expand a professional network and learn about opportunities, then join accounting club. If you’re interested in entrepreneurship, check out founders u/foundersUIUC . If you’re interested in the hoeft technology and management minor/interested in engineering and business, I’d say join u/nobeillinois : the National organization for business and entrepreneurship. If you’re interested in technology and business, check out the disruption lab (look at gies groups for this one on the calendar under 24 August 2020 because it’s application based and I just recently ran into this). If you’re interested in consulting, there’s a wide variety of organizations (like students consulting for nonprofits). If you’re a minority, there’s minority business students association (MBSA). If you’re interested in marketing, there’s American marketing association. If you’re a female in business, there’s society of women in business. If you’re into supply chain, there’s supply chain management association. If you’re interested in information systems, there’s association for information systems. If you’re female and interested in finance, there’s women in finance. If you’re interested in finance, I’d say join prime’ mergers and acquisitions or maybe investment portfolio organization (both are application based if I recall correctly). If you’re interested in competitions on a state and national scale with connections to different universities and majors and professionals, join Phi Beta Lambda (this isnt a frat per se. I have a few friends in this one). There’s so many options!!

I can’t stress enough that business frats aren’t everything. The goal of RSO’s is to provide you with experiences and connections and also depends on how involved you are within your organizations. I’m not going to say don’t join a business frat. I’m just trying to say that don’t feel like you need to because there’s a lot out there. Also, don’t feel like you need to be in all business organizations. It’s again about your experiences and involvement within that organization. Personally speaking, I’m not in all business organizations and I get asked about my involvement in those other organizations and talk about that often too. Definitely take some time looking at the different RSO’s there are and decide what types of organizations you’re interested in (e.g. consulting, major specific, minority related, etc.). Dm if ya want. I know some of the bus frat kids may downvote this galore lol"
PREP student class schedule,"Take advantage of the data on the [GPA visualizations](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/) when selecting a professor. In your case, where you need to meet a GPA requirement, you probably should always pick the professor with the highest average GPA. 

MATH 241, CHEM 102, and PHYS 211 are all very challenging courses. Spend some time reading through other Reddit posts where people comment on ways to succeed in these classes and I would recommend also getting a head start in winter break to start learning some of the core concepts that are taught in the courses (it will only make your life easier next semester).

I personally would be cautious when adding additional technical courses on top of these three. Adding one more **easy** technical class should be okay, but be prepared to work hard next semester."
Virtual Quad Day Fall 2020,"Great question!! Just posted about this a little bit ago :) hope it helps:


https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/iey88c/info_about_virtual_quad_day_and_virtual_gies_quad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Hey, hope this helps everyone still confused because I know the details were VERY confusing to many because there wasn’t much proper advertisement/tutorials for figuring out how all of it works. It was tricky even for officers. Here’s the link to the platform: [https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/](https://illinois.campuslabs.com/engage/)

You’ll need to sign in with your NetID and Password to make an account if I recall correctly, then at 12 Central time, the link will go live to actually attend the fair, titled “Virtual Quad Day 2020: A New Spin event”, then you get in and can view everything. Don’t hit request to join (because this make you request to join the official RSO roster) but there should be a thing to join online to actually engage with the officers on the zoom/video conference app the RSO is using

Alternatively, you can go to organizations and filter by categories you like and want to join and make a list on a document or something, then go through the above process to streamline the process for yourself and have a more set idea of organizations you want to join, then visit the zoom links. Some organizations may have some issues because some zoom links had a password protected zoom link issue on Saturday, so double check on the organization’s social media if something changed in terms of links!

Also, if you have a LinkedIn, for organizations you have to apply to, it may be helpful to link it in your profile and add a photo :) not required but I think it helps you feel more human by having a complete profile haha 

Hope this helps!!! Feel free to add something in the comments if I missed something or if something’s confusing! I’ll be active near 12pm central time as well so if there’s any questions during quad day, I’ll try to help out! 


Also sorry if this was the wrong flair lol but I hope people find it. Also, business quad day (if you’re a business major) is live on gies groups from now until September 25 and different things are happening at different times in terms of info nights (gies groups is here:  [https://giesgroups.illinois.edu/](https://giesgroups.illinois.edu/)  )

I hope this helps too :) for gies groups just sign into the platform using your Net ID. Again, definitely recommend updating your profile and such. When you hit the home button on the top left, there should be an option for virtual fairs, and then when you click on that, business quad day should pop up. From there, hit view all groups and you can see what each group has to offer on their virtual booth :)

Also gies groups has a lotta gies related events too so definitely keep an eye on gies groups often :) really hope you all find the RSO communities you need. 

And don’t worry if you’re remote!! A lot of organizations ARE going virtual for this semester and potentially next semester (but this depends on RSO’s!)"
textbook help,Wait until the syllabus gets released and the prof EXPLICITLY states that you need it. Check amazon and Facebook marketplace
When can teachers read ices reviews?,They are not available to the instructors until after the grades have to have been posted.
Is Self Service down?,"Seems like it. I keep trying to get in to update my address information since they required that, can’t get into it."
Premed at UIUC?,"uiuc is really good for engineering pre-med. pretty well for general pre med. I say pretty well as in - UIUC is a good school for nearly everything (include bio/psych premed), but there are many more opportunities for engineering or business students.

but yes, UIUC premed would be better than, lets say, ISU premed because UIUC is a better school that ISU. so it just depends on where you could get in. looking at prestige of the university vs prestige of the program."
less lecture time than class is supposed to be??,"Wait, which class is this?"
Any basketball hoops open on campus?,"Courts at the ARC are open, half-court only, one person per hoop. I’d go there to get more details about it."
Are you graded based on your lecture group or your discussion group?,Depends on the course.
Question from a freshman who is planning to transfer to gies in sophomore year,"Well you need to have a certain minimum gpa to be considered by them, don’t know it off the top of my head, taking easy classes isn’t a bad idea, but keep in mind they can see what are the easy classes as well. Also I don’t recommend dropping down to 12 credit hours either, because if you start doing poorly in the class you can still drop, but if you’re at 12 you don’t have that luxury. Plus they can see if you’re at 12 credit hours so they’d likely expect you to do extremely extremely well since your work load would be so light."
Conflict exams,"Email your professor about the issue. They shouldn't be giving you a different test, but if you are worried about that, you could offer to take the test earlier. Creating another exam is more work for them."
Freshman schedule question,"You do not have to pay more even if you were to go over 18 credit hours. I did 21 hours last semester and did not have to pay anything extra. In my opinion, adding gen eds like Thea 101 is not much of a burden. It is a good GPA buffer as well."
Any fluent Korean speakers?,There is a fb page for uiuc koreans. You could probs find someone from there
Meal Plan Rollover?,"Nope, they do not. Use as many as you can, and since it’s all takeout this year you could even store some meals in a mini-fridge for a few days."
UIUC Hair Salon?,"\+1 point for going to the Tricoci beauty school! $8 for a simple haircut, and you're not even allowed to tip so that's the true cost (something something regulations something students). The students are definitely supervised, the instructor comes over before every major stage and double-checks (or sometimes does a large portion of the cut if the student is super new)."
Physics (325) Prereqs,"Obligatory ""ask your advisor""

For real tho, I've found the uni to be super lenient with prereqs. I'm taking Phys. 486 right now and I'm missing two prereqs for it. Especially if you've taken 441, I wouldn't worry about it."
Minoring in spanish?,I am minoring in Spanish. Overall I have to because the rest of my siblings had to but it will definitely help in some ways when out in the real world
RSOs and COVID,"RSO presidents received an email on Thursday saying that we’d get an email the next day about facilities usage and expectations for RSOs. But we never got an email.

There’s a workshop next Thursday (it was supposed to happen last Thursday afternoon, but on Thursday night they announced that they’re delaying it) which will hopefully finally have some answers about what RSOs are able to do on campus this semester."
IB 150 textbook,tbh the number one rule is to always wait for like the first week of classes to see what your teachers actually want! sometime they even give you the cheapest way to get them! I had ib 150 with clegg last semester and I never used the book tbh but I found the pdf online (if you want I can send it to you). but he also required a course manual that we had to buy and that’s where I did all of my work like it had practice problems and lecture notes! also a lot of the work was online cause he had lecture videos with problems on them that really helped! so with all of that I suggest waiting for the class to start to see if you wanna buy the book but I doubt you should! I got an A with just taking really good notes and doing the work!
So I join an RSO if I’m an online only student?,Plenty of RSOs will have virtual meeting options. If you go to the info meetings or message them through campus labs you should be able to find some to join!
Can you live off campus as a freshman?,[deleted]
Freshman looking for apartment help/advice (completely new),"This is a long convo that basically - make friends with an upperclassmen to have now. 

you can start searching now. 600 a month is decent with roommates, depends on your quality of living expectation and # of roommates. is that including utilities.

People sign leases in September of the current year for the following school year (9-11 months in advanced). That's right, freshmen sign leases with people they've known for 3 weeks (and sometimes live with someone they aren't friends with because of it). At most other schools, people don't start looking at housing until the spring semester so 3-6 months. That's why you may be seeing so many sublease posts. At other schools, this wouldn't be as big of a concern.

However, I'm hoping because of all this covid stuff, people dont sign leases until spring semester, and we reset the housing system in CU."
Senior grades,"Yes everyone here at UIUC can see your grades, even all of the students. Try to bring your grade up a little in math, but good job overall.  /s"
Cheapest/Best Eye Exam?,How about Illini Eyecare on green street? You gotta make an appointment first and they’re booked up really quick. You’ll probably need to wait for more than half a month for eye exam. I believe the cost is lower than $100.
Rental Parking Spaces,I would ask various apartment buildings near you to see if you can rent a space from them. Prices can be steep though
CLCV 224 Workbook?,also wanting to ask this as well
Cengage subscription options,What’s your major?
Easiest rhet 105 online teachers?,Took it this sem with Hollis Druhet. Amazing guy and extremely relaxed with deadlines and such.
Are there any differents between pgn and phi gamma nu beta phi? Thanks,that’s too many Greek words for my brain to handle
Are there exercise bikes at the ARC?,yep lots of em
Place to fix computer?,Do you need someone to fix it or are you looking for a shop where you can work? Simplified Computers on Neil Street a few blocks south of Green works on all kinds of computers. Long history in community.
Gen Ed Advice🥺,KIN 249
What are some ez 2nd 8 week courses for general education,I’m taking an online Intro to NRES course the second half

Do I need to cancel my housing contract a second time if I already did so in the fall?,It's for a year
Cheap Customized T-Shirts for RSO,"CustomInk has decent quality, but that might cost too much. You could also look into vinyl printing."
Nail salons?,"Dazzling nails is pretty close by, it’s on green street and the prices are fair"
No Linked Details found. Please contact your administrator,"Not 100% sure but make sure you sign up/drop all the required sections (lecture, discussion, labs if there are any) at the same time"
Anyone have these textbooks,I have an old chem 103 lab manual if you want
CS 460?,Pretty sure they're killing the course
Drivers license alternative?,Next best thing for Identification purposes would be a passport if you have one
"Illinois In-State Residency Status Near, but After, First Class Date?",I believe you can for anything but engineering. I think engineering you have to apply for the fall semester.
Textbook Pickup at Bookstore,"2 years ago, the 13 Silver was great for getting to the bookstore. It dropped off at Transit Plaza (which is right outside the bookstore). 


Honestly, spend a day getting lost and riding the bus around until you figure out the routes. It's a life saver when you find yourself drunk somewhere between Green and Daniel"
In person RSOs?,"Something athletic would probably be in person oriented. The reality is RSOs do most of their stuff through zoom when they can, and there might be some events or subgroups within the RSO doing in person. I doubt theres an RSO doing entirely or most of their events in person."
Competitiveness in these majors,109
MATH 220,His course videos are a very good resource and I'm glad he decided to keep them up
How to drop class??,Just go into self service and in your current class list there should be an option to web drop class
Basketball courts on campus,They ain’t opening them. We’re lucky they opened the tennis courts behind PAR. if you want to play you’re gonna have to go off campus unfortunately.
MATH 234,No. Unless you want to revisit the topics to brush up your memory.
Transfers,"Depends greatly on your major but it can be impossible or difficult depending on the major and your performance.

Packages,"put your dorm address, hall, room number in the future!it’ll get to you, you just have to go to sdrp to pick up if you live in ike. i assume your package will get there i doubt you’re the only person who’s done this. it wouldn’t hurt to call them and verify!"
Where to study,"Krannert Center for the Performing Arts has a huge lobby (can hold several thousand people in normal times). It has been configured with some number (at least 30 I believe) study stations which are appropriately separated. Lobby has good air turn over too. You can generally enter via the stairs to the ""front doors"" on Goodwin Ave or via Orange Parking (Illinois Street side). Read the signage there to know what doors are open at what times. University COVID rules prohibit food or drink consumption in the study areas."
VM or RDP?,i used teamviewer to my home computer quite a bit last year with no issues
URGENT: Do any of the UIUC markets sell shout?,You might want the [UIUC Stain Solutions guide](https://web.extension.illinois.edu/stain/).
Packages in dorms,"Packages will be delivered to the front desk (or another nearby area). They don’t leave them outside or at your door or anything like that. Occasionally there will be some clerical errors and lost packages in general, but nothing like porch pirates"
direct deposit question,Usually a couple days after the refund is posted on your account
Dorms next year,"From other posts, if you don’t come in the spring you’ll be forced to dorm your entire sophomore year. 
 
It’s not that bad truly, but it’s a very different vibe than apartments, so it’s your choice"
I want to defer until Fall 2021 as an incoming freshman. I need some pointers on how to do this.,contact admissions
How does Get Fresh! work?,"I did it last year and liked it. It’s def good for too people, and they provide recipes you can make with the stuff you get. It’s $50 for the full 6 or 8 weeks or whatever, so it’s not bad compared to the store for fresh, organic produce."
Do Cafe Credits work on the restaurants in the Union?,They do not.
adding classes for term B help,Check and make sure you aren’t going to hit the 18 credit hour limit or even just refresh or log out and back in
Education to AHS,I transferred from community college into SHS my junior year and I’d say it’s fairly easy! As long as your grades are decent I don’t think it’s super competitive or anything
Rate my second semester freshman year schedule!,"Not bad, but I wouldn't take the community college course while taking the other courses. 4-5 courses is enough by itself already."
Parking at the ARC,"I’ve been parking at the ARC, 3-4x a week, for months and never got a ticket lol"
Where is the Chem 102 Zoom meeting??????????,who do you have? for huang it’s on compass
"Looking for application pointers, and major advice please!",r/chanceme
RSOs for CS,"It's kind of obvious, but have you checked out ACM? There's plenty of SIGs, so you can probably find something, no matter what subfield of cs floats your boat."
kitchen in par,"Across from the convenience store, there’s a hallway going into the multipurpose room and it’s on the right side (the vending machines share a wall with it)"
How do I figure out my grade for Math 221?,Check the grades section on Learn@illinois
Newbie in need of help with dropping a class,Talk to your advisor and they can help walk you through it
THEA 101,Hahaha. 1% effort gets you a 100% in the class. Take it online though.
Calc 2 “special approval”,"Just try to register for the section you want on Enterprise, it does a pretty good job with it's restrictions and will give you a warning if you are not allowed to register. If you get no warnings while registering, most likely you will be completely fine."
When do CS freshman usually begin applying for summer internships?,Start right now! You will get a lot of rejections but eventually you'll get an interview and hopefully an offer.
What day of the week do your meals reset?,"Normally Saturday night, Sunday morning, see the ""Prorated Meals"" section on [https://housing.illinois.edu/Dining/Meal-Plans/How-Plans-Work](https://housing.illinois.edu/Dining/Meal-Plans/How-Plans-Work).

This week is just strange. Breakfast today was supposed to be the first meal, I'm not exactly sure how things have been prorated up to today."
Illinois commitment,"Basically you fill out FAFSA and if your household income is less than 60k (i think) you can qualify for illinois commitment but the school will determine it by looking at your financial need, so you don’t need to send in an application or anything"
Class Times Disappeared,[deleted]
LAS 101 Interview,"It's literally more work to ""fake it"" than it would be to do an interview. One of the goals of the assignment is to teach basic ""networking"" skills: How to identify resources and individuals that can be helpful to you and then initiating contact with that person. It's as simple as getting on a faculty member's or advisor's schedule, or sending a short introductory email. Trust me, whatever career you go into, you will be sending your share of ""cold open"" emails - practice doing them now so when they matter more (for a job or internship), you'll feel more confident and have improved your communication skills."
Thoughts on taking Discrete Math(CS 173) and Diff EQ(Math 285) in the same semester?,Doable - I know quite a few mates doing the combo (I'm only in 213 rn) and they are managing it well. I can't speak on diffeq but 213 isn't that bad.
Adding any course in PrairieLearn?,Yes
Libraries open,You have to book an appointment online to reserve study spaces. I think you can go to the undergrad library website and it should be there :) hopefully this helps !
Prospective First Year: Is my first/second choice major selection binding if enroll?,Yes you enter with whatever major you are are admitted as. After two semesters you are then able to change majors if you want/need to.
HELP! Is it okay to change class after the first week?,Yes just look up your colleges add/drop deadlines it shouldn’t be for awhile
Packet-Loss solutions/Ethernet in Allen Hall,Are you sure that this is a local problem? There was a [fairly major internet disruption](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24322861) earlier today that may be having lingering effects.
Questions about CS + X,"Freshman in CS + Econ here, I wasn't expecting to get in but I got in after a deferral of the early admission application. I had a 1430 on the SAT and 4.23 GPA btw. Good luck 👍"
CS173 with Benjamin Cosman,https://reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/k49ihi/cs_173/geaab9a/
Switch Class to Online,"would you want to cancel your housing contract if you switched to online? or would you still live in your dorm, go to the cafeteria/gym/union, etc.? if the latter is the case, I don’t see the added harm in having one in-person class."
What meal plan should I choose?,"10/45 for the win lol

I lived in the ike freshman year and had 10/45. The cafe credits are like a weekly allowance, if you pick the 10/45 you get 45 cafe credits, or basically 45 dollars to spend at ike 57 (the kind of small general food store inside the dining hall). You can also spend them to buy steaks or premium meals. If you live somewhere else im not too sure where to spend them."
Econ 202 vs stat 100,"You *can* do stat 100 and then Econ 203, but 202 then 203 will be easier in the long-run imo. Like stat 100 may seem better in the short run bc of how easy it is, but to get a better preparation for 203 and beyond you’ll probably want to take 202."
Opinion on CLCV 120?,"Probably one of the hardest classes at this school, if not *the* hardest."
How do appointments at McKinley work?,You call and make an appointment
McKinley Pharmacy?,✨call and ask them✨
"If loans start being distributed on August 16th, and I need to reduce one loan, will I be out of luck if it doesn't go through by Sunday?",I took out a large parent plus loan and then changed my plans and took the semester off. They let me cancel my parent plus loan less than a week before classes started. I would imagine it wouldn’t be hard for them to reduce your plus loan if they let me cancel mine so easily.
CLCV 114 Paper example,"I took this class fall 2018, I don’t remember what my prompt was exactly, but I remember he basically gave every an A as long as they made a sincere effort. If you can, write a rough draft and then go to office hours and ask your professor to go over it and provide feedback"
Webassign Question,You can find the login for UIUC [here](https://www.webassign.net/uiuc/login.html) . You should have a free 2 week trial then you’ll have to pay.
Why are bars open but the libraries closed?,"Bars are businesses and don’t belong to the university. The university gets a say on what academic buildings can stay open and all, but they don’t get a say on how private businesses are run"
"Target Compared to ""County Mark-Up"" Food Prices","I was thinking the same exact thing. It’s CRAZY how cheap target seems in comparison to county. And this is coming from a guy who never shopped at target, because it was too expensive (in comparison to Walmart).

That being said, I’m really happy with the Target. I think it’s a great place to go, at least between Walmart trips. I hopefully will never have to step foot in county again"
"rant: no, left on red does not exist ppl",I'm constantly encountering left on read
Update on the Target,"That's nice and all, but do you know if the new Target will be open by this fall?"
Online classes are really worsening my eyesight,"I'm not sure on where you can get eye exams in the area, but something you can start doing in the meantime (if you haven't already) is implementing color filters on your screen(s). I have been using f.lux (free software) and a built-in ""night shift"" mode on my laptop and phone to combat this same problem and my eyes felt much better than they did this summer.

Also, just because I know they're popular, I haven't heard anything about ""blue light glasses"" holding merit in doing what they are marketed to do, but maybe someone more proficient in that can offer their take."
Random girls terrorizing me and my roommates (what can I do to make it stop)?,"bro if a group of people walked up to my front door and just started kicking it I'm calling the cops, you've been more than lenient"
"PSA: For new students on campus, the sirens are a monthly test.","I always wonder what people from places that don't have these tests think when they hear the sirens for the first time? I'm thinking either WW2 bombing alarms, or Silent Hill."
What are some cheap takeouts on campus?,"bro i love Bangkok Thai on green, their portions are big and the food tastes good. Just make sure to call them or just order in person because there is another bangkok thai somewhere else in the city on grub hub that is no where near as good. I like the pad thai, the pad see ew, and the crab rangoon its a basic order but their noodle dishes can last for awhile and reheat well.
I would also say getting a meat dish from sakanaya is a good option but they aren't really that cheap unless you make it last for two meals, which for some of them i think is doable. 
Eating out on green street is hard but if you stick to places with large portions you can make some of the higher upfront costs work."
private place to cry?,"Green areas near Spurlock. 
There's a loading dock area near Levis Center & the adjacent building that's private.

Places up on outside of Krannert Center.

Area behind Campus Honors building.

Use I Card & sit in very back of the bus for a full round trip. The rocking of the bus can be comforting.

The Pollinarium area.

Arboretum area- 
Outside of the Arboretum, to the south, are some benches that are shady, private, & off the main Arboretum traffic path 

Japan House hills- between Japan House & Orchard Downs .

Wildflower area at Orchard & Florida (on busline) .

McKinley Foundation labyrinth can be comforting. Same for labyrinth in Crystal Lake Park.

4th Street extension between St Mary's Road& Windsor- can meander & find places.

Cemetery at Griffifth & St Mary's Road."
Kind of anxious right now...chances of being robbed? Outside or inside?,"If you’ve grown up in a city, basically treat Champaign like that for now. For those who are uninitiated:

When outside: 

No earbuds/headphones (easy target).

Keep your head on a swivel. This means preferably don’t look down at your phone the whole time.

Take brightly lit routes, and whenever possible, travel in groups

When inside:

If you are in a first floor with windows, you’re probably fine. Easy targets with unlocked doors or who answer are less likely to get caught than a smash and grab. That being said, don’t leave your switch, laptop, and other valuables in sight.

If you’re in a secure building, you’re also probably fine.

If you’re in a walk up, this is the highest risk. Make sure to never answer the door unless it’s a known postal worker in uniform (USPS, UPS, FedEx), or it’s someone you know and invited over.

If you’re worried about someone trying to break in while you’re around, go buy a doorstop for $5 (little wedge thing for under your door). It’s unlikely, but that’s probably peace of mind.

Finally, and I know this will probably get downvotes:

If something feels wrong (and you feel comfortable doing so) call the police; it’s better to be a false alarm and safe than robbed/hurt because you didn’t."
Important Ravioli Related Question,"It has been significantly over a year since I've attended one of those things, but I vividly remember the fried ravioli."
County Market Workers Without Masks,Call the store service desk during the day and ask to speak to Ian the head manager of the Campustown location. Be specific about your complaint and he'll likely tell you he'll take care of it right away. The store number is 217-352-4123.

Anyone know of any trans friendly psychiatrists in the area?,"There's a lot of trans-friendly therapists & psychologists in the area, although I'm not so sure about psychiatrists. I know that counseling services here keeps their own list of trans-friendly shrinks to refer people to, there's a list of trans health resources that the LGBT Resource Center maintains, and people in CUTES (Campus Union for Trans Equality and Support) could probably recommend a few. I can personally recommend a few myself if you'd like.

The first two you'll need to hit up yourself, but let me know if you want a link to the CUTES discord."
What’s the deal with the Panda Express?,"I submitted a question to Tom from Tom's Mailbag, if anyone can find out -- it's Tom."
Resturant Margins,"Most other places in the world have provided funds to keep businesses and workers afloat.  Blame the R's in the US congress for never taking up the second bill to help these folks. Thank you for helping - we do something similar. Clearly it is on us all as the Feds will never help as long a King McConnell sits on his throne. This form of government was not designed to have someone like him, representing so few people, be able to control the country for so many years."

Any homeless shelters in the area take baked goods?,"I'd call up Cunningham's Children Home to ask if they'd take some- if they do, the kids there might appreciate it! 

Unfortunately, Eastern Illinois Foodbank won't take homemade goods, but dropping the name regardless in case you or anyone has some cans or food they could take."
Good mac and cheese on or closeish to campus??,Noodles and company has a Wisconsin Mac and cheese that goes pretty hard
A good place to raise kids?,"A lot of people in the Champaign area move to Mahomet because the schools are better and cost of living is lower than Champaign. 

If you want your kids to go to Champaign schools, Savoy is a great option because they goes to Champaign school, but property tax is literally half of what Champaign has."
Recommendation for local counselors/therapist?,In the past we have seen others recommend Kevin Elliot Counseling as a good option. In part because they have 20+ counselors in their group so you can i guess try several until you find someone you relate to if change is needed. They are doing phone or perhaps zoom sessions these days as per a radio ad I heard. Not optimal perhaps for some counseling  needs but it sounds like that will need to be all there is for some months. Call any place and tell them your insurance situation and they can explain what the co-pay will be. Elliot used to (May still) have an office on campus so I would guess they accept student insurance.
Lost key fob near the quad,"My friends and I found it on the quad last night, we turned it in to the police station!"
Where are some nice places to go hiking?,"Meadowbrook has trails through woods and prairie, isn't too far from campus. Busey woods isn't far either. 

If you can figure out how to get there Allerton Park is great for hiking. About 30-45 mins outside of Champaign. It's owned by the U of I but I don't think a lot of students know about it. Lots of trails, random statues of centaurs and shit out in the middle of the forest. There's also a coffee shop. Lodge Park is out that way too. Also a pretty cool loop trail, forget the name of it though."
smartphone,"I’d recommend blink mobile as I used to work there but sadly they didn’t survive the pandemic and closed their doors. 

I do have an older model that’s nice and simple, if you want I can let you have it for very cheap or only delivery charge. It’s this one I have listed here. Locally I can do $10 and deliver within or close to campus.

Verify that your vote is counted?,"FAQ sez: Ballots are checked in, verified, and cast by a 3-judge panel with  judges from both parties. This ensures everything is done according to  statue and accurately. If you log into [My Voter Information](https://champaigncountyclerk.com/elections/my-voting-information),  it will tell you when your ballot has been received by the Clerk's  Office. If there is anything that would prevent your ballot from being  cast, the Clerk’s Office would contact you immediately to rectify the  issue.

So just like when you slide your ballot into the tabulator you give over control to the system to actually count the vote. In this case they will feed it into the tabulator. But it will be visually inspected and they will contact you if there is a problem with it."
Advice on High Schools in Urbana/Champaign,"Longtime Urbana resident here:

One of my kids went to UHS (graduated a semester early 5+ years ago) and the other graduated from Uni High within the last few years. Both schools have their issues; both are solid schools for college prep if the kids I’ve known over the years are any indicator. UHS, as I recall, had more Ivy acceptances per capita than Uni High for a number of years, but Uni High has one of the best guidance/college counselors on the planet in Lisa Micele (she has appeared many times on national NPR talking about college prep and the admissions process). 

FWIW, we’re not wealthy, nor are we faculty, but both of my kids are college grads from solid schools, and one of them is currently in grad school (the other is planning to apply for next fall).

Sadly, I know very little about the schools in Champaign. I have a lot of general opinions about the schools in this area given their proximity to an R1 institution, but that’s for another time. Hope this helps!"
Fried Chicken on Campus?,"If you liked bbq, try star karaoke's chicken. They are both Korean style chicken but star one is more ""homemade Korean"" style. You can order from Ubereats or doordash."
Thanksgiving Break on Campus,Drink
"Anyone know the proper name for Golden Harbor's ""signature crispy tofu/eggplant""?","Following. Golden Harbor is flat out the best Chinese food anywhere outside of Chinatown, and would hold its own in SF imo.  

One perhaps non-obvious thing is Chinese eggplant is very different from the kind we normally see in the states, so you'll need to work on sourcing that. Here in town Fresh International almost always has it in stock for a good price, but smaller Asian markets usually don't stock as much fresh produce. 

Also Golden Harbor might be willing to share some tips if you post on their FB page?"
ADHD Evaluations?,I’d reach out to DRES and ask them for guidance. Good luck

Is Busey Woods a safe place to go for a run alone?,"Female townie runner here. It isn’t exactly “unsafe,” but I think if you aren’t from in town and you’re a girl running alone, I’d avoid it just because it could be easy to get lost and end up in a sketchy area almost a mile from campus. (The park is usually fine but some of the areas nearby are poorer neighborhoods that it would be best not to run through alone). I would recommend running at Meadowbrook park or the Arboretum, as both of those places are very safe but also have plenty of nature to appreciate."

Where's a good place to go to be truly alone in Chambana?,"I would recommend heading south of campus past Research Park in the early evening.

Any place I can get good doughnuts close to or on campus?,"Ye Olde Donut Shop on Neil at Birch has good ones. They have been around off and on for decades. A block north of the RR track underpass at Kirby.

buses for sure run west out near Carmellas on Springfield a bit east of Mattis. Nothing expensive there - just lots of good yeast and cake donuts."
chocolate covered strawberries ?,All you need is coating chocolate (called almond bark sometimes) from Walmart (cheap) and a microwave to melt it. You’ll save alot money.
What grocery delivery service do you recommend?,"My experience with instacart has been awful. They make substitutes not authorized, gave away a bag of my groceries to someone else, do not keep to appointed delivery times, and their customer service is unresponsive and inefficient. It is also pretty expensive. On a scale of 1 to 5, they get a 0.25 from me."
Social distancing date ideas?,The Arboretum and Curtis Orchard are beautiful this time of year. And totally outside and plenty of space for distancing.
Thoughts on Pavlov Media?,The place I stayed in this year had internet included in their rent and used Pavlov. Tbh it was a little slow at times but that can be attributed to 4 people using my WiFi at once. I didn’t have any major problems with the connectivity or customer service (granted I only called them once)

Therapists that see UIUC students for lower costs??,"The counseling center has same day appointments for your first time, then you schedule weekly or however often you need after that. It’s already included in your student fees so might as well use it. I’ve only had good experiences there tbh. They also have group therapy that I attend regularly"
Mckinley still open?,"Hopefully you have by now, but go to the ER. McKinley won’t take you if you didn’t pay summer insurance, and the ER is much better qualified to disinfect your wound and give you stitches for something like that."
Fun things to do around campus while not catching the covid?,"Explore the tunnels on campus. They can be found under Noyes, the Ugl, and turner. If you can get into the main library, 4 floor bathroom right next to the staircase has access to the roof (although it is usually locked). If you go towards the soccer fields near FAR and just keep going eventually you'll hit a farm with cows and horses which is a ton of fun to do at night. You could probably pet them (at youre own risky obviously) Go on the quad in the middle of the night alone and just lay on the quad without music. Climb the alma and go people watching."
Transport to ORD airport,"Peoria Charter started a taxi-like service during the pandemic, but I don't know if they're still doing that. The last time I checked it was over $200 for a one-way trip, though, so that might not work out. Also have you thought about renting a car? I'm not sure how many companies would allow you to rent from one airport and drop off the car at another, but that could be a possibility."
Any platform offering Jerusalem restaurant delivery?,"from what I read from some posts here on the subreddit back during the summer, the owner is not tech-savvy and so is not on any delivery service locally. For now just doing a take-away operation (you CAN call him and it'll be ready for you to pick up 15 minutes later). He is open limited hours, is a little bit grumpy in person (!) but once he realizes you're a regular, he gives you even larger portions. His food is quite delicious, fresh, and at a super low price. I hope he sticks around for a long time just as he is! :) :)"

Haircut place for guys?,"Supreme Fades on Green (bit before Busey Bank): they *do* give things other than fades lol, and I've been pretty happy with them every time. Not really cheap though. 

Juno's also good  I hear (right next to Spoon House), but also not cheap. 

Cheaper options include Pizzazz on First and Green (which I've generally heard good things about) and King's Barber Shop on McCullough (have to tell him *exactly* what you want to get the cut you want) but it's definitely the cheapest out of these options."

Power went off in Urbana?,"Just a PSA, but definitely call into Ameren if you see shady looking branches near power lines.  Likely nothing that can be done when it comes to sudden 40+ mph gusts, but we had two 16+ hour outages just west of Campus within two weeks.  Enough of us called to where they finally sent some guys (good dudes-- nothing against the laborers) to police the alley of rainforest going on between the property lines.  With any luck tonight won't be #3.

And bank on keeping your fridges closed.  Consider it a nice surprise if you have your lights back on before the morning.  Last major outage they had a very unlucky skeleton crew going from site to site in order of time reported.  Poor guys looked dead by the time they got to us at like noon the next day.  I believe before driving off to try and redirect our power, the words were ""You're either gonna have your power back on or you're gonna hear an extremely loud pop a few blocks over.""  Safe to say all fucks were probably depleted by that point, not that I can blame them.  In any case, looking like a very similar situation this evening."
Advice on joining a fraternity as an engineering student,"Personally, I think that joining an engineering fraternity is a good move.  I'm currently in Sigma Phi Delta, and it's been extraordinarily helpful in all my classes. You're bound to be able to get help in nearly every class, either from people taking it with you or older guys who have already taken it. 

Even beyond classes, when it comes to internships and jobs, I know a handful of guys, myself included, who have been able to secure some work because of a connection another guy in the fraternity has.

We'll be sending out our Fall rush schedule very soon. I suggest you come to some of these events to learn more about our fraternity, and talk more with some of us. You can also visit our website [here](https://sigphis.org). I'm a rush chair for this semester, so if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me either here on reddit, or my email dspatz2@illinois.edu."
Purchasing at Meat Sales Room v grocery store?,"No, it's not cheaper for common and cheap cuts of meat.  If you want something exotic, maybe it's cheaper."
Christmas things to do?,"Hardy's Reindeer Ranch (Rantoul, IL) - 25 min drive 

Go to Kickapoo. They have activities for all seasons (Danville, IL) - 35 min drive"
BBQ Chicken Premium Closing Down?,I would try calling Babplus as they have the same owners. Really hope they didn't close as their fried chicken is really good!
Swimming Holes,"Kickapoo state park is probably closest to what you are looking for, its about 40 minutes though. If you drive 20 minutes any direction from Champaign all you will see is corn."
Urbana Farmer's Market Recommendations,"Everything is fantastic! I haven't been able to go this summer unfortunately, but literally everything. I usually got veggies n stuff from Sola Gratia and Blue Moon Farms. There's a vendor, at least last year, that sells fresh mushrooms too. Campbell Apiaries has great honey. 😋

Many of those vendors also go to the Champaign one on Tuesday afternoons too! Downtown in the big parking lot on Neil. :)"
"Any good places to skate, plus indoor skate parks?",[deleted]
Driving,"If you have a car, lot E-14"
Where’s a good place to skateboard on campus?,There’s a skate park on north elm st in Champaign. There’s also another one in the boulder ridge subdivision.
How is Christie Clinic?,"It WILL be expensive, with or without university health insurance. There will likely be surprise billing as well. Christie is an LLC, which means they look to increase their profits any way they can at your expense. Carle is a (pretend) ""non-profit"", meaning they try a little harder to hide their profit-making. In short, both are predators, but this is the USA, where in healthcare you are confronted with rip-offs at all levels. A little bit like higher education in this country, right? Best of luck! Except for being rushed through a 15 minute appointment, you will likely get adequate treatment at Christie or Carle. There is essentially no difference in quality."
Who’s coming back after break?,"Hello, ""literally not leaving campus"" gang."

"Unknown FedEx package from Vietnam, what should I do with it?",Probably ask the authorities and don’t open it their was recently a scam with people sending random seeds from China for fake reviews but just to be careful I’d probably notify someone instead of opening it if your not sure

Dunkin happy hour gone??,Everything happy has been cancelled by the state. Did you ask about if they have a “miserable hour” special?
Where to Get Violin Serviced?,"I had the exact same stuff done to my violin + bow at The Music Shoppe up by Marketplace Mall. Quality of work was fine, the turnaround time left a lot to be desired- took one month instead of two weeks- but that could be because it was back in May when  they were dealing with all of their school rentals."
Honest question,Where do you think the wind blows them? They do not disappear. They do what they do in a forest. They collect into mats and often kill the human desired vegetation beneath. Leaves are good mulch in some locations but they just move from place to place in the wind. Oak leaves in particular (and we have many oaks here) are like roofing shingles. They do not break down for a long time.
Does anyone know how to get an antibody test down here?,"What I did:

Miracle help with a missing wallet,if they used an atm there’s a video of them using it or if they went into a restaurant they most likely have video of them taking it or using it.  I would strongly recommend calling the cops with the atm number/where it was used and the time and they’ll have a suspect in minutes.  any charges to your card provides unbelievable amounts of evidence.

How to use library number on online library apps like Overdrive?,"I’d get a Champaign library card. It isn’t hard to set up, they have a TON of resources, and you could use your card at Urbana too. I got a public library card when I got to campus and it one of the best things I’ve done for myself in quarantine."
Is McKinley good for back pain?,"Go to McKinley first. The care is not as bad as everyone likes to complain. They'll likely recommend PT and change in habits (posture, sit less).

McKinley is free. A visit to a place like Carle may run you $100+ (they charge facility fees at a standard and then you'll have to pay your deductable/co-pay but I don't know the specifics if your plan). A lot of the people who say ""go somewhere else!"" say that because mommy/daddy either pay their bills so they don't realize the cost or their parents' insurance has a better negotiated rate at places like Carle."
Any place to go on campus for an appointment?,What facility is needed? Electricity? Special lighting?
lets talk turkey - suggestions for a smallish bird,"I usually do a turkey breast, gives you a nice Thanksgiving feel, but you wont be eating turkey leftovers until the next thanksgiving. They're usually about 5-7 lbs and they're near the whole turkeys in the grocery store"

Did anyone get their money from Suburban Express?,I got a check from the settlement back in March.
Neighborhoods with Victorian houses?,"Champaign - University Ave - west of downtown has some structures from that era.

Urbana - just east of Lincoln and north of Springfield - you will find a few. 

If you mean painted ladies type places most have been converted to rooming houses, run down, torn down.  There are Queen Anne types sprinkled around the neighborhoods south and west of State Street/University in Champaign. That part of Champaign was built late 1870s-1930. Very mixed. A lot have aluminum siding and nasty additions on them. But there are some very nice examples too. 

There are a few along Illinois east of Lincoln as I recall. Some near Leal grade school.  There is one hidden from view behind Gameday Spirit. 

Green Street was once lined with such places."
Where are some places on campus that we can reserve so that we can study together?,"UGL and Grainger are supposed to open single seat study reservations ~Sept. 14.

Developing film at Chambana,Do you mean where you can do the developing? If not Walgreens stores have a photo developer machine and can do it for you.

Mechanic recommendation for car pre-purchase inspection?,"kcm auto is my friends' go-to auto shop, they're super nice"
"With the Armory closed, is there a good place to do interval running on campus?",Try the arboretum. Plenty of grass to run in and you don't have to run on the same loop over and over
What’s up with Peoria charter?,"I don't think they've offered trips to the suburbs for awhile now. It's been limited since last semester, so the only option is O'hare.

Edit: I meant the only option during the holiday season is to O'hare."
Fourth and Daniels,They probably monitor traffic to control the lights. I don't think they have ticketing cameras in Champaign-Urbana

Public tracks (indoor/outdoor) in the Urbana-Champaign area?,I used to run at Centennial HS track. Not sure if it’s still open but maybe worth trying. Or St. Jo is normally open but a little drive.

best tattoo shops?,"I got mine done at no regrets and they were great! I found the tattoo artist who's work I liked on Instagram and reached out to him directly to set up an appointment. I think it was pretty fairly priced (I believe it's cheaper than the shops on campus but not sure) and the people were super nice!

I'd say beyond the shop, make sure you find an artist you like too because every artist has different styles and pretty much all of them have Instagram or Facebook accounts showcasing their work. Once you like an artist's work, then you can reach out to them directly in most cases. If not you can call the shop then!"
Places to fix glasses?,"There’s a glasses place on Green Street that will do adjustments by Legends, but they charge $5 because otherwise students would take advantage apparently. That’s what they told me when I got mine adjusted a year ago."
Anyone know a good restaurant in Decatur?,"La Gondola serves up excellent Italian-American food in big (but very tasty) portions and really reasonable prices. It's nothing fancy inside, but that doesn't matter right now anyway, since they probably are not serving indoors due to the pandemic regulations. And they are NOT open on Sundays...

Best Wireless Providers in Champaign?,"1) Is not relevant. Minutes are almost always unlimited these days. 
2) Do you need unlimited data? 4 GB is not a lot, most cheap mvnos offer it. 

I personally like Mint a lot, it's cheap if you prepay for 12 months and since it's based on T mobile the network is pretty solid too."

Any Pop-Up Shops on or near Campus?,I work for a student-run clothing-swap company called Karma Trade! It's located in the heart of Urbana. Definitely give it a whirl.
Taking out food during Fall 2020,"If your fear is contracting COVID from the food, I wouldn't worry too much about that. I've been to restaurants on campus since the stay-at-home order started and everyone is masked, gloved, sanitizer is everywhere so I believe most are taking the necessary precautions. I bet at this time, they would greatly appreciate your business too!"

"Dog friendly, outdoor, eating establishments",The downtown bars are pet friendly. I always see people sitting outside with their dogs by their feet at places like Esquire and Guidos. I do not believe campus town itself is allowing people to eat at their locations just yet.
Crafting Locations,"Info on the CU Fab Lab, which is indeed taking appointments for different kinds of activities. It looks like it's $7/30 minutes for the laser cutters. [http://cucfablab.org/open-hours-appointments/](http://cucfablab.org/open-hours-appointments/)  


The two laser cutter options say they can handle acrylic and plywood, but you might want to check with them just in case to ensure your materials are okay for their machines if you choose to go there."
CocoMero dine-in open?,"All indoor dining rooms are closed while we are in phase 3. I guess that doesn't prevent them from being open illegally (apple dumpling), or there might be a loophole where you can rent to a private group or similar"
Driving test at Champaign DMV?,"The lines at Champaign DMV can last for hours.    Literally.    That DMV has been understaffed for years, compared to the amount of business it gets.   Best to arrive before they open on a business day and bring a book.   It can be faster to drive to one of the nearby small towns with a DMV (e.g. Monticello), because their lines are supposedly much shorter.

Notice that their long lines have to be largely outside due to covid precautions.    So plan accordingly."
Dental Insurance,"Dental insurance that is not subsidized by an employer is not really worth it.  It normally won't cover major things (fillings, etc.) until after you've had the insurance for 3-6 months.  And what you pay annually in insurance is more than the cost of the cleaning, dentist's exam and periodic x-rays.

Btw, be careful with x-rays.  Offices will charge for full sets of x-rays for new patients when they don't need to, or really shouldn't (our mouths don't need mutiple mouth x-rays).  

Please read this: [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/upshot/you-probably-dont-need-dental-x-rays-every-year.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/upshot/you-probably-dont-need-dental-x-rays-every-year.html)  ""*Adults without apparent dental problems do not need dental X-rays of any kind every year, the A.D.A. says. Adults who properly care for their teeth and have no symptoms of oral disease or cavities can go two to three years between bitewing X-rays, according to the A.D.A.""*"

To the protestors in front of Lion,Glad they held a mass gathering during a pandemic to protest businesses
I'm University of Illinois Police Chief Alice Cary. Ask me anything.,"*From* u/uiucboy192*:*

*Why has there been so much crime recently on campus, like the attempted robbery from yesterday? What can students do to protect ourselves?*

Great question. Unfortunately, we tend to get calls like this at the beginning of the year. The weather is nice, so people are outside late at night. A lot of our students who are new to our campus are still getting their bearings and have yet to adjust to their new environment. All of these dynamics create more opportunity for crime in the early part of the fall semester.

We do have a very safe campus area. Most campuses are very safe. However, no community of our size will ever be entirely crime-free, and we are deluding ourselves if we want to believe that there will ever be no crime at all. So it’s important that we are realistic about this and take steps to protect ourselves.

We truly, truly need people to not walk alone late at night, and use well-let routes wherever possible. This is the single best way to eliminate the opportunity for crime. Don’t let yourself be distracted by your phone. Stay aware of your surroundings (this means don’t listen to music while you’re walking at night). Use SafeWalks if you need it. Walk with confidence – even if you’re lost, pretend that you are not. 

Someone else suggested using pepper spray in response to this question. That’s fine if you want to carry pepper spray, but we would recommend keeping it on a keychain or in your hand ready to go in case you need it. And practice using it (on an inanimate object in a well-ventilated area). You don’t want to be trying to use it for the first time when you truly need it."
Business majors listen up...,As a senior in college of business I can attest to what op says. Challenge yourself and try new things. Don't sleep on consulting orgs.
Nuclear Micro-reactors: Ask us anything!,"I firmly believe that nuclear energy is a key component to a sustainable, carbon-neutral, future. I also know that US nuclear power has the safest track-record in terms of deaths per unit of energy generated when compared to other forms of power generation. 

Despite the stellar safety and environmental record, the general population seems to still oppose nuclear power on an emotional level. 

* How is the project going about public outreach to address the common misconceptions with nuclear energy? 

* Do you anticipate a public backlash? 

* What is the best environmental elevator pitch for nuclear energy?"
Be here Monday from 6-9 p.m. for an AMA with faculty and students to discuss nuclear micro-reactors!,"I’d fully support a nuclear reactor to cover 100% of CU needs. The US could gain from being less superstitious about modern nuclear reactors - this is really great work.

Nuclear power just might save our environment for hundreds more years."
AMA with UIPD Chief Alice Cary on Oct. 1 from 3-5 p.m.,"Please keep in mind the rules of Reddit and /r/uiuc as you ask questions and post comments. Criticism is absolutely fine, but personal attacks and threats against others are not fine. As usual, the mods will remove any questions or comments that violate reddit rules independent of the opinions that are expressed within them."

"UIUC Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning AMA on Remote Instruction Resources for Undergrads, TODAY 11 AM – 1 PM!","Resource alert: [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest). Many of you might already be familiar with Quizlet; it's an app/website that you can use to create your own study flashcards or use those created by others. However, it goes beyond just simple ""flip the card over"" mechanisms; there are built-in modes that help you focus on different aspects of studying, like memorizing terms, writing them, spelling them, etcetera; there's some gamier elements as well to spark quick recall. [5 Research-Backed Studying Techniques](https://www.edutopia.org/article/5-research-backed-studying-techniques) mentions the value of practice quizzes for memorizing and remembering things, but let's be honest: giving yourself practice quizzes is really boring. The most gamified aspects of Quizlet, both in its learning modes and its quizzing modes, make this a little less painful."

"UIUC Alum, Current UIC Nursing Student AMA","I have a friend joining the program in the spring. She’s a very good student but she is stressed out because it’ll be a different change of pace from what she’s used to. 

Any words of wisdom, advice, things you wished someone told you going into it, things you’d do differently? Thanks!"
