40,Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.,0
41,The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.,0

52,"The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.",0

62,"FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.",0
63,The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913.,0
64,"The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world.",0

80,"In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894.",0
81,It was named the British Ladies' Football Club.,0
82,"Nettie Honeyball is quoted, ""I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured.",0
83,"I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.""",0
84,Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football.,0

87,"Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier.",0
88,"The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England.",0
89,"The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22–0.Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.",0
90,Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.,0
91,This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.,0
92,"It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.",0

99,Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game.,0
100,"The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference, known as the football (or soccer ball).",0
101,"Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal.",0
102,The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw.,0
103,Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.,0
104,"The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart.",0
105,"Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, ""heading"" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms.",0
106,"Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.",0
107,"During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper.",0
108,"Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted.",0
109,"Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules.",0
110,"After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals.",0
111,"For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.",0
112,"The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved.",0
113,"Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team.",0
114,"Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.",0
115,These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time.,0
116,"For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders.",0
117,The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination.,0
118,"The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play.",0
119,"While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.",0
120,The layout of a team's players is known as a formation.,0
121,Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.,0
122,"There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines.",0
123,"The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted.",0
124,"The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.",0
125,"The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).",0
126,"In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.",0
127,"Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper.",0
128,"Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven.",0
129,"Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.",0
130,"Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards.",0
131,An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.,0
132,"Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.",0
133,"Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches.",0
134,The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game.,0
135,"The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches.",0
136,"Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game.",0
137,"In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.",0
138,"IFAB recommends ""that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team"".",0
139,Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.,0
140,"A game is officiated by a referee, who has ""full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed"" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final.",0
141,The referee is assisted by two assistant referees.,0
142,In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent there being controversy.,0
143,video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes.,0
144,"There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.",0
145,"The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 cm (27 and 28 in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 g (14 to 16 oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 standard atmospheres (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch)  at sea level.",0
146,"In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.",0
147,"As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.",0
148,"The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd).",0
149,"Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square.",0
150,"In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (115 yd) long and 68 m (74 yd) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines.",0
151,A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.,0
152,"The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 m (24 ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 m (8 ft) above the ground.",0
153,"Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.In front of the goal is the penalty area.",0
154,"This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them.",0
155,"This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick.",0
156,"Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.",0
157,A standard adult football match consists of two-halves of 45 minutes each.,0
158,"Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play.",0
159,There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves.,0
160,The end of the match is known as full-time.,0
161,"The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages.",0
162,"This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while lost time can also be used as a synonym.",0
163,The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee.,0
164,"Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of ""effective playing time"".",0
165,The referee alone signals the end of the match.,0
166,"In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add.",0
167,The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number.,0
168,The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.,0
169,Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa.,0
170,"Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty.",0
171,"Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 minutes had elapsed and the game was over.",0
172,"The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.",0
173,"In league competitions, games may end in a draw.",0
174,In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays.,0
175,"A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods.",0
176,"If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as ""kicks from the penalty mark"") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament.",0
177,"Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses.",0
178,"Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home.",0
179,"If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.",0
180,"Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play.",0
181,"From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee.",0
182,"When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
Kick-off: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.",0
183,Throw-in: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.,0
184,Goal kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.,0
185,Corner kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.,0
186,"Indirect free kick: awarded to the opposing team following ""non-penal"" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred.",0
187,A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.,0
188,"Direct free kick: awarded to fouled team following certain listed ""penal"" fouls.",0
189,A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.,0
190,Penalty kick: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.,0
191,"Dropped-ball: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.",0
192,A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play.,0
193,The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12.,0
194,"Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of ""penal fouls"", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred.",0
195,Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card).,0
196,"A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal.",0
197,"A player given a yellow card is said to have been ""booked"", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook.",0
198,"If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play.",0
199,"Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad.",0
200,"In particular, the offence of ""unsporting behaviour"" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences.",0
201,"A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player.",0
202,"Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed.",0
203,"This is known as ""playing an advantage"".",0
204,"The referee may ""call back"" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within ""a few seconds"".",0

209,"Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.",0
210,Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole.,0

219,"209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.",0
220,International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues.,0
221,"International football, without qualification, most often refers to the former.",0
222,"In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.",0

259,"Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.",0
260,It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.,0
261,"For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).",0
262,Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.,0
263,"There are four types of chemical bonds: covalent bonds, in which compounds share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which a compound donates one or more electrons to another compound to produce ions (cations and anions); hydrogen bonds; and Van der Waals force bonds.",0
264,"The word chemistry comes from alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine.",0
265,"It is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold, though in ancient times, the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early 4th century Greek-Egyptian alchemist Zosimos.",0
266,"An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix ""-ry"" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as ""chemistry"".",0
267,The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء).,0
268,"In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία.",0
269,"This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language.",0
270,"Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία, meaning ""cast together"".",0
271,The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model.,0
272,"Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter.",0
273,"Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination.",0
274,"The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together.",0
275,Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.,0
276,The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware.,0
277,"However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.",0
278,A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.,0
279,The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms.,0
280,"It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects.",0
281,The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal.,0
282,"(When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.)",0
283,"The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.",0
284,Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies.,0
285,"Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions.",0
286,"They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g.",0
287,spectroscopy and chromatography.,0
288,Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.,0
289,Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines.,0
290,"Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:




In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles.",0
291,"The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon.",0
292,Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.,0
293,The atom is the basic unit of chemistry.,0
294,It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud.,0
295,"The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus.",0
296,"In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons.",0
297,"The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).",0
298,"A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol Z.",0
299,The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus.,0
300,"Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes.",0
301,"For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.The standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number.",0
302,"The periodic table is arranged in groups, or columns, and periods, or rows.",0
303,The periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.,0
304,A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element.,0
305,The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements.,0
306,The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).,0
307,Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system.,0
308,The names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system.,0
309,"When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components.",0
310,In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances.,0
311,In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number.,0
312,"A molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances.",0
313,"However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below).",0
314,"Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs.",0
315,"Thus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions.",0
316,"When this rule is broken, giving the ""molecule"" a charge, the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion.",0
317,"However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer.",0
318,"Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered ""molecules"" in chemistry.",0
319,"Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals.",0
320,"Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.",0
321,"The ""inert"" or noble gas elements (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way.",0
322,"Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various pharmaceuticals.",0
323,"However, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules.",0
324,"These other types of substances, such as ionic compounds and network solids, are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se.",0
325,"Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance.",0
326,"Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as table salt), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite.",0
327,One of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure.,0
328,"While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.)",0
329,"the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.",0
330,A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties.,0
331,A collection of substances is called a mixture.,0
332,Examples of mixtures are air and alloys.,0
333,The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount).,0
334,"One mole is defined to contain exactly 6.02214076×1023 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the Avogadro constant.",0
335,"Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3.",0
336,"In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals can exist in several phases.",0
337,"For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties.",0
338,"A phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as pressure or temperature.",0
339,"Physical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase.",0
340,"The phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.",0
341,Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary' in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state.,0
342,"When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.",0
343,"The most familiar examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases.",0
344,Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases.,0
345,"For example, there are three phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure.",0
346,"A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms.",0
347,"Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).",0
348,"Less familiar phases include plasmas, Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials.",0
349,"While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.",0
350,Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another.,0
351,A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.,0
352,"More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.",0
353,"A chemical bond can be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force.",0
354,Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential.,0
355,These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals.,0
356,"In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.",0
357,"An ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion.",0
358,"The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them.",0
359,"For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−.",0
360,"The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.",0
361,"In a covalent bond, one or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a molecule.",0
362,Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a noble gas electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom.,0
363,Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the octet rule.,0
364,"However, some elements like hydrogen and lithium need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the duet rule, and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas helium, which has two electrons in its outer shell.",0
365,"Similarly, theories from classical physics can be used to predict many ionic structures.",0
366,"With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used.",0
367,See diagram on electronic orbitals.,0
368,"In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure.",0
369,"Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved.",0
370,Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.,0
371,A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse.,0
372,"A reaction is said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.",0
373,Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy.,0
374,"The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor

    {\displaystyle e^{-E/kT}}
   – that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation.",0
375,"The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound.A related concept free energy, which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in chemical thermodynamics.",0
376,"A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the Gibbs free energy is negative,

  ; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at equilibrium.",0
377,"There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules.",0
378,"These are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system.",0
379,The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited.,0
380,"The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.",0
381,The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings.,0
382,"When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H2O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds.",0
383,"Whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker dipole-dipole interactions.",0
384,The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance.,0
385,"However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer.",0
386,"Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy.",0
387,"For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.",0
388,The existence of characteristic energy levels for different chemical substances is useful for their identification by the analysis of spectral lines.,0
389,"Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical spectroscopy, e.g.",0
390,"IR, microwave, NMR, ESR, etc.",0
391,Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects – like stars and distant galaxies – by analyzing their radiation spectra.,0
392,The term chemical energy is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction or to transform other chemical substances.,0
393,"When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred.",0
394,"A chemical reaction is therefore a concept related to the ""reaction"" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both.",0
395,"It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.",0
396,"Chemical reactions can result in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more molecules or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules.",0
397,Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds.,0
398,"Oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid-base neutralization and molecular rearrangement are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.",0
399,A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation.,0
400,"While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz.",0
401,protons and neutrons.The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism.,0
402,"A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed.",0
403,Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction.,0
404,Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction.,0
405,Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions.,0
406,"Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.",0
407,"According to the IUPAC gold book, a chemical reaction is ""a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species.""",0
408,"Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an elementary reaction or a stepwise reaction.",0
409,"An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable.",0
410,"Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e.",0
411,'microscopic chemical events').,0
412,"An ion is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons.",0
413,"When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation.",0
414,"When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion.",0
415,"Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts, such as the Na+ and Cl− ions forming sodium chloride, or NaCl.",0
416,Examples of polyatomic ions that do not split up during acid-base reactions are hydroxide (OH−) and phosphate (PO43−).,0
417,"Plasma is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.",0
418,A substance can often be classified as an acid or a base.,0
419,There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior.,0
420,"The simplest is Arrhenius theory, which states that acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water.",0
421,"According to Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.",0
422,"A third common theory is Lewis acid-base theory, which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds.",0
423,"Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond.",0
424,"According to this theory, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.",0
425,"There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods.",0
426,"One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is pH, which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative logarithmic scale.",0
427,"Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration and can be said to be more acidic.",0
428,"The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the acid dissociation constant (Ka), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid.",0
429,"That is, substances with a higher Ka are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower Ka values.",0
430,Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation).,0
431,"Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants or oxidizers.",0
432,An oxidant removes electrons from another substance.,0
433,"Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers.",0
434,A reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus oxidized itself.,0
435,"And because it ""donates"" electrons it is also called an electron donor.",0
436,Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur.,0
437,"Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.",0
438,"Although the concept of equilibrium is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.",0
439,"A system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not static; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a dynamic equilibrium.",0
440,Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.,0
441,"Chemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry.",0
442,"Some of them are:




The history of chemistry spans a period from very old times to the present.",0
443,"Since several millennia BC, civilizations were using technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry.",0
444,"Examples include extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.",0
445,"Chemistry was preceded by its protoscience, alchemy, which is an intuitive but non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions.",0
446,"It was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, but, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry.",0
447,Chemistry as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy began to emerge when a clear differentiation was made between them by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist (1661).,0
448,"While both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was given by the scientific method that chemists employed in their work.",0
449,"Chemistry is considered to have become an established science with the work of Antoine Lavoisier, who developed a law of conservation of mass that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena.",0
450,"The history of chemistry is intertwined with the history of thermodynamics, especially through the work of Willard Gibbs.",0
451,"The definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science.",0
452,"The term ""chymistry"", in the view of noted scientist Robert Boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies.",0
453,"In 1663, the chemist Christopher Glaser described ""chymistry"" as a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection.The 1730 definition of the word ""chemistry"", as used by Georg Ernst Stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.",0
454,"In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered the word ""chemistry"" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.",0
455,"This definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances – a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling.",0
456,"More recently, in 1998, Professor Raymond Chang broadened the definition of ""chemistry"" to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes.",0
457,"Early civilizations, such as the Egyptians Babylonians, Indians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but didn't develop a systematic theory.",0
458,"A basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical Greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination.",0
459,"Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus.",0
460,"In 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things).",0
461,"Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.An early form of the idea of conservation of mass is the notion that ""Nothing comes from nothing"" in Ancient Greek philosophy, which can be found in Empedocles (approx.",0
462,"4th century BC): ""For it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed.""",0
463,"and Epicurus (3rd century BC), who, describing the nature of the Universe, wrote that ""the totality of things was always such as it is now, and always will be"".In the Hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life.",0
464,"Work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early Byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-Egyptian Zosimos of Panopolis.",0
465,"Alchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the Arab world after the Muslim conquests, and from there, and from the Byzantine remnants, diffused into medieval and Renaissance Europe through Latin translations.",0
466,"The development of the modern scientific method was slow and arduous, but an early scientific method for chemistry began emerging among early Muslim chemists, beginning with the 9th century Perso-Arab chemist Jābir ibn Hayyān (known as ""Geber"" in Europe), who is sometimes referred to as ""the father of chemistry"".",0
467,"He introduced a systematic and experimental approach to scientific research based in the laboratory, in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were largely allegorical and often unintelligible.",0
468,"He also introduced the alembic (al-anbiq) of Persian encyclopedist Ibn al-Awwam to Europe, chemically analyzed many chemical substances, composed lapidaries, distinguished between alkalis and acids, and manufactured hundreds of drugs.",0
469,His books strongly influenced the medieval European alchemists and justified their search for the philosopher's stone.,0
470,"In the Middle Ages, Jabir's treatises on alchemy were translated into Latin and became standard texts for European alchemists.",0
471,"These include the Kitab al-Kimya (titled Book of the Composition of Alchemy in Europe), translated by Robert of Chester (1144); and the Kitab al-Sab'een (Book of Seventy) by Gerard of Cremona (before 1187).",0
472,"Later influential Muslim philosophers, such as Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, Avicenna and Al-Kindi disputed the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of the transmutation of metals.",0
473,"Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline.",0
474,"Boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text The Sceptical Chymist where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry.",0
475,"He formulated Boyle's law, rejected the classical ""four elements"" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.",0
476,"The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.Before his work, though, many important discoveries had been made, specifically relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases.",0
477,"The Scottish chemist Joseph Black (the first experimental chemist) and the Dutchman J.B. van Helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what Black called 'fixed air' in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated pure oxygen.",0
478,English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.,0
479,"The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, J.J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta.",0
480,Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.,0
481,British William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen.,0
482,J.A.R.,0
483,"Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements in the 1860s by Dmitri Mendeleev and independently by several other scientists including Julius Lothar Meyer.",0
484,"The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.",0
485,At the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms.,0
486,"In 1897, J.J. Thomson of Cambridge University discovered the electron and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and Marie Curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity.",0
487,"In a series of pioneering scattering experiments Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.",0
488,"His work on atomic structure was improved on by his students, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and Henry Moseley.",0
489,The electronic theory of chemical bonds and molecular orbitals was developed by the American scientists Linus Pauling and Gilbert N. Lewis.,0
490,The year 2011 was declared by the United Nations as the International Year of Chemistry.,0
491,"It was an initiative of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and involves chemical societies, academics, and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities.",0
492,"Organic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, reducible to chemistry.",0
493,Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).,0
494,Chemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines.,0
495,There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.,0
496,Analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure.,0
497,Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry.,0
498,"These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.",0
499,"Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals, chemical reactions and chemical interactions that take place in living organisms.",0
500,"Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in medicinal chemistry or neurochemistry.",0
501,Biochemistry is also associated with molecular biology and genetics.,0
502,Inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds.,0
503,"The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry.",0
504,"Materials chemistry is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function.",0
505,"The field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials.",0
506,"Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, polymers) and interfaces between different phases.",0
507,"Neurochemistry is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.",0
508,Nuclear chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei.,0
509,"Modern Transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.",0
510,"Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds.",0
511,An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.,0
512,Physical chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes.,0
513,"In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists.",0
514,"Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, and more recently, astrochemistry.",0
515,Physical chemistry has large overlap with molecular physics.,0
516,Physical chemistry involves the use of infinitesimal calculus in deriving equations.,0
517,It is usually associated with quantum chemistry and theoretical chemistry.,0
518,"Physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from chemical physics, but again, there is very strong overlap.",0
519,Theoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics).,0
520,In particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry.,0
521,"Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems.",0
522,Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics.Other disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study.,0
523,"These include inorganic chemistry, the study of inorganic matter; organic chemistry, the study of organic (carbon-based) matter; biochemistry, the study of substances found in biological organisms; physical chemistry, the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as thermodynamics and quantum mechanics; and analytical chemistry, the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition and structure.",0

820,"Despite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is ""a short burst of inconsequential information"", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labeled ""pointless babble"" is better characterized as ""social grooming"" and/or ""peripheral awareness"" (which she justifies as persons ""want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable"").",0

852,"These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads).",0

890,Twitter has offered two different methods of archiving one's own Twitter account data.,0
891,Those methods have their individual benefits and disadvantages.,0
892,"Since August 2019, only the latter archival method is available.",0
893,"In December 2012, Twitter introduced a ""Tweet archival"" feature, which created a ZIP file that contains an offline-browsable archive of all tweets.Those exported tweets could be browsed and searched offline by using the bundled user-interface accessible through an Internet browser, which used client-side, JavaScript-powered pagination.The user interface of the tweet archive browser had a design similar to Twitter's 2010–2014 desktop user interface, even until the feature's removal.",0

903,Another disadvantage is that one can only generate one of these archives per 30 days.,0
904,"After obtaining this archive, one has to wait 30 days until requesting the next archive is possible.",0

985,"The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed that they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack to a Java server they call Blender.Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake, and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'.",0
986,The URL shortener t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL.,0
987,"Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives an acknowledgement that the tweets were sent.",0
988,Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API.,0
989,"The process is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms.On August 16, 2013, Raffi Krikorian, Twitter's vice president of platform engineering, shared in a blog post that the company's infrastructure handled almost 143,000 tweets per second during that week, setting a new record.",0
990,Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies.The service's application programming interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter.,0
991,"Twitter introduced the first major redesign of its user interface in September 2010, adopting a dual-pane layout with a navigation bar along the top of the screen, and an increased focus on the inline embedding of multimedia content.",0
992,"Critics considered the redesign an attempt to emulate features and experiences found in mobile apps and third-party Twitter clients.The new layout was revised in 2011 with a focus on continuity with the web and mobile versions, introducing ""Connect"" (interactions with other users such as replies) and ""Discover"" (further information regarding trending topics and news headlines) tabs, an updated profile design, and moving all content to the right pane (leaving the left pane dedicated to functions and the trending topics list).",0
993,"In March 2012, Twitter became available in Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu, the first right-to-left language versions of the site.",0
994,"About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options.",0
995,"In August 2012, beta support for Basque, Czech and Greek was added, making the site available in 33 different languages.In September 2012, a new layout for profiles was introduced, with larger ""covers"" that could be customized with a custom header image, and a display of the user's recent photos posted.",0
996,"The ""Discover"" tab was discontinued in April 2015, and was succeeded on the mobile app by an ""Explore"" tab—which features trending topics and moments.In September 2018, Twitter began to migrate selected web users to its progressive web app (based on its Twitter Lite experience for mobile web), reducing the interface to two columns.",0
997,"Migrations to this iteration of Twitter increased in April 2019, with some users receiving it with a modified layout.In July 2019, Twitter officially released this redesign, with no further option to opt-out while logged in.",0
998,"It is designed to further-unify Twitter's user experience between the web and application versions, adopting a three-column layout with a sidebar containing links to common areas (including Explore), and features from the mobile version (such as multi-account support, and an opt-out for the ""top tweets"" mode on the timeline).",0
999,"During an outage, Twitter users were at one time shown the ""fail whale"" error message image created by Yiying Lu, illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned ""Too many tweets!",0
1000,"Please wait a moment and try again.""",0
1001,"Web designer and Twitter user Jen Simmons was the first to coin the term ""fail whale"" in a September 2007 tweet.",0
1002,"In a November 2013 WIRED interview Chris Fry, VP of Engineering at that time, noted that the company had taken the ""fail whale"" out of production as the platform was now more stable.Twitter had approximately ninety-eight percent uptime in 2007 (or about six full days of downtime).",0
1003,The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.,0
1004,"Twitter messages are public, but users can also send private ""direct messages"".",0
1005,"Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public, though accounts can be changed to ""protected"" which limits this information (and all tweets) to approved followers.",0
1006,Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy.,0
1007,The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.,0
1008,"While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user.",0
1009,"A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith.",0
1010,"Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing.",0
1011,The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account.,0
1012,"Within a few weeks of this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.On January 5, 2009, 33 high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a dictionary attack.",0
1013,"Some of the compromised accounts sent falsified tweets, including drug-related messages.Twitter launched the beta version of their ""Verified Accounts"" service on June 11, 2009, allowing people with public profiles to announce their account name.",0
1014,"The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.In May 2010, a bug was discovered by İnci Sözlük that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge.",0
1015,"For example, comedian Conan O'Brien's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.In response to Twitter's security breaches, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought charges against the service; the charges were settled on June 24, 2010.",0
1016,This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses.,0
1017,"The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a ""comprehensive information security program"" to be independently audited biannually.On December 14, 2010, the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks.",0

1021,The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites.,0
1022,"The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets.",0
1023,"Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14.",0
1024,"Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' and used it to post coloured messages.",0
1025,"Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for ""onMouseOver"", and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself.",0
1026,"Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for ""fun and games"", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals.",0
1027,"Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that ""The exploit is fully patched.""",0

1140,"Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty, promotes informal learning, allows shy students a forum for increased participation, increases student engagement, and improves overall course grades.Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education, as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea, or knowledge sharing, in and outside the classroom.",0
1141,"By using or creating hashtags, students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice, to enhance and promote education.",0
1142,"A broad example of a hashtag used in education is ""edchat"", to communicate with other teachers, and people using that hashtag.",0
1143,"Once teachers find someone they want to talk to, they can either direct message the person, or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat (science), engchat (English), sschat (social studies).In a 2011 study, researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers, encourage interactive learning, and ultimately lead to high grades.",0
1144,"In the same study it was found that out of a group of 158 educators, 92% agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is, another 86% agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn, and finally, 93% said they use Twitter because it is free.",0
1145,"People found that sifting through large amounts of data is challenging, however, with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible.",0
1146,"Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag, and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates.",0
1147,"These features help to promote education outside the classroom in a global setting where students and educators are easily able to create, connect, and share knowledge.",0
1148,"This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators, not just in the classroom, but virtually and around the world.",0
1149,"Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 that using Twitter for ""literate communication"" is ""about as likely as firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad"".",0
1150,"In September 2008, the journalist Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into ""a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world"".",0
1151,"One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis.",0
1152,"Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that ""the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful.""",0
1153,"In that same vein, and with Sigmund Freud in mind, political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well-crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader’s personality: the id, ego, and superego.The poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled Selected Tweets featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years.",0
1154,"The book was designed to look like a small bible.The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called ""Some Contemporary Characters,"" composed entirely of tweets.In 2009, Nielsen Online reported that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent.",0
1155,Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all Internet users.,0
1156,"In 2009, Twitter won the ""Breakout of the Year"" Webby Award.",0
1157,"During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements.",0

1160,"Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to determine the influence of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook.",0
1161,The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher.,0

1168,A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts.,0
1169,"The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.According to an analysis of accounts, the heads of state of 125 countries and 139 other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than 350,000 tweets and have almost 52 million followers.",0
1170,"However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts.Donald Trump has used Twitter as a method of providing ideas and information during his presidential campaign in 2016, the transitional period and as US President.",0
1171,"A study performed at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology showed his tweets from these different time periods and through analysis of his tweets, the professors found that President Trump uses a mode called ""forensic mode"" the most often in his tweets.",0
1172,"This is described as a quick reactive usage, as they found he often used Twitter to show his judgment of the events that occurred regarding both his allies and his enemies.",0
1173,"After his election to the presidency he tweeted this ""forensic-style"" tweet, ""Just had a very open and successful election.",0
1174,"Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting.",0
1175,Very Unfair!,0
1176,""".In a study done at New York University in 2015, an analysis and comparison of the Twitter accounts of Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, found observations showing the goals of each candidate's Twitter during their respective primary elections.",0
1177,Some comparisons that were made were the use of Aristotle's theory of Rhetoric.,0
1178,"The research found that Donald Trump used pathos, the appeal to emotion, in his rhetoric; Bernie Sanders tended to use ethos and logos for his Twitter; Hillary Clinton tended to use logos and pathos to try to convey her values, and Jeb Bush shows that he uses a mix of all three on his account.",0
1179,The study also looked at the media response to the tweets during the election.,0
1180,"The study found that the tweets became more persuasive for the candidates if the media put the tweets in front of more viewers, versus less powerful if they were only visible to those already on Twitter.",0
1181,"In that way, presidential candidates who had their tweets covered more in the news were able to get their message to more potential voters.",0
1182,"More than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals manage active Twitter accounts, nine of whom were cardinal electors for the 2013 Papal conclave.",0
1183,Pope Benedict XVI's Twitter account was set up in 2012.,0
1184,"As of April 2016, his successor, Pope Francis, has 9.06 million followers of his Twitter account (@Pontifex).In a 2015 European Foundation for Democracy-European Policy Centre policy dialogue panel in Brussels, Mark Wallace, CEO of the ""CounterExtremism Project"" and former U.S ambassador to the United Nations, said: ""Twitter is currently the 'gateway drug' for those seeking to recruit fighters for Islamic terrorism and this must be stopped.""",0
1185,Twitter is increasingly used for TV to be more interactive.,0
1186,"This effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen, ""virtual watercooler"" or social television—the practice has been called ""chatterboxing"".",0
1187,"Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the Oscars, the Super Bowl and the MTV Video Music Awards; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.",0
1188,"Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen entered a multi-year agreement to produce social TV ratings, which are expected to be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating.",0

1195,"On launch, the concept was limited to NBCUniversal channels and Xfinity cable television subscribers.In an attempt to compete with Twitter's leadership in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts.",0
1196,"It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people.",0
1197,"In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time.",0

1199,"However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later.",0
1200,"These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the ""second screen"" – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media.",0
1201,"With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of premium TV content onto the social platform in the form of in-tweet real-time video clips.",0

1569,"In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment.",0
1570,"Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.",0
1571,"He started developing this machine in 1834, and ""in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer"".",0
1572,"""A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom"" making it infinitely programmable.",0
1573,"In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.",0
1574,"Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM.",0
1575,"Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published  the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history.",0
1576,"In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit.",0
1577,"When the machine was finished, some hailed it as ""Babbage's dream come true"".During the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the Atanasoff–Berry computer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.",0
1578,"As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general.",0
1579,"In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City.",0
1580,The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science.,0
1581,"The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world.",0
1582,"Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and the university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.",0
1583,Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.,0
1584,"The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953.",0
1585,The first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.,0
1586,"Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.",0
1587,"Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.",0
1588,It is the now well-known IBM brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time.,0
1589,"IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704 and later the IBM 709 computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices.",0
1590,"""Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again"".",0
1591,"During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.The concept of a field-effect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925.",0
1592,"John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947.",0
1593,"In 1953, the University of Manchester built the first transistorized computer, called the Transistor Computer.",0
1594,"However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.",0
1595,"The metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.",0
1596,It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.,0
1597,"The MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuit chips, leading to what is known as the computer revolution or microcomputer revolution.Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology.",0
1598,"Modern society has seen a significant shift in the demographics which make use of computer technology; usage has shifted from being mostly exclusive to experts and professionals, to a near-ubiquitous user base.",0
1599,"Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of humanitarian aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators.",0
1600,"As computer adoption became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.",0
1601,"Although first proposed in 1956, the term ""computer science"" appears in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in 1921, justifying the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.",0
1602,"His efforts, and those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe, were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with Purdue in 1962.",0
1603,"Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves.",0
1604,"Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.",0
1605,"Certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference.",0
1606,"Danish scientist Peter Naur suggested the term datalogy, to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers.",0
1607,"The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy.",0
1608,The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries.,0
1609,"An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is now used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.",0
1610,"In the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the Communications of the ACM—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, and applied epistemologist.",0
1611,"Three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by hypologist.",0
1612,The term computics has also been suggested.,0
1613,"In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression ""automatic information"" (e.g.",0
1614,"""informazione automatica"" in Italian) or ""information and mathematics"" are often used, e.g.",0
1615,"informatique (French), Informatik (German), informatica (Italian, Dutch), informática (Spanish, Portuguese), informatika (Slavic languages and Hungarian) or pliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in Greek.",0
1616,Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh).,0
1617,"""In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.",0
1618,"""A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—Edsger Dijkstra, states that ""computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.""",0
1619,The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science.,0
1620,"For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering, while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems.",0
1621,"However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines.",0
1622,"Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, Earth science, statistics, and logic.",0
1623,"Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.",0
1624,"Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Rózsa Péter and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.The relationship between Computer Science and Software Engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term ""Software Engineering"" means, and how computer science is defined.",0
1625,"David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis.",0
1626,Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science.,0
1627,Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.,0
1628,A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.,0
1629,"Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.",0
1630,"Peter Denning's working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.",0
1631,"Amnon H. Eden described them as the ""rationalist paradigm"" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the ""technocratic paradigm"" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the ""scientific paradigm"" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence).",0
1632,"Computer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification, implementation and testing of human-made computing systems.",0
1633,Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.,0
1634,"As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS)—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture.",0
1635,"In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.",0
1636,"Theoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation.",0
1637,"Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.",0
1638,Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations.,0
1639,"In an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation.",0
1640,"The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.",0
1641,"problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems, is an open problem in the theory of computation.",0
1642,"Information theory, closely related to probability and statistics, is related to the quantification of information.",0
1643,This was developed by Claude Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.,0
1644,Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application.,0
1645,"Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding.",0
1646,Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.,0
1647,Data structures and algorithms are the studies of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.,0
1648,"Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features.",0
1649,"It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics.",0
1650,"It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.",0
1651,"Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.",0
1652,"The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.",0
1653,"They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved.",0
1654,Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing.,0
1655,"For industrial use, tool support is required.",0
1656,"However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance.",0
1657,"Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.",0
1658,"Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals.",0
1659,"From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence.",0
1660,"AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding.",0
1661,""", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the Turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence.",0
1662,But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.,0
1663,"Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.",0
1664,It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.,0
1665,"The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.",0
1666,"Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other.",0
1667,"A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi and the Parallel Random Access Machine model.",0
1668,"When multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency, this is known as a distributed system.",0
1669,"Computers within that distributed system have their own private memory, and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals.",0
1670,"This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide




Computer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.",0
1671,Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information.,0
1672,"Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.",0
1673,"A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily.",0
1674,"Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages.",0
1675,Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets.,0
1676,Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data.,0
1677,"The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including computer vision, image processing, and computational geometry, and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games.",0
1678,Scientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems.,0
1679,"A major usage of scientific computing is simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others.",0
1680,Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft.,0
1681,"Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs.",0
1682,The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.,0
1683,"Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build.",0
1684,"It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software.",0
1685,"Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance.",0
1686,"The philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Insights of Computer Science:
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's, George Boole's, Alan Turing's, Claude Shannon's, and Samuel Morse's insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent ""anything"".All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as ""on/off"", ""magnetized/de-magnetized"", ""high-voltage/low-voltage"", etc.).",0
1687,"Alan Turing's insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do ""anything"".Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:move left one location;
move right one location;
read symbol at current location;
print 0 at current location;
print 1 at current location.",0
1688,"Corrado Böhm and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do ""anything"".Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
sequence: first do this, then do that;
 selection: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
repetition: WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.",0
1689,Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming).,0
1690,Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways.,0
1691,"Common programming paradigms include:

Functional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.",0
1692,"It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.",0
1693,"Imperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.",0
1694,"In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.",0
1695,Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.,0
1696,"Object-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of ""objects"", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.",0
1697,A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.,0
1698,"Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.Many languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.",0
1699,Conferences are important events for computer science research.,0
1700,"During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet.",0
1701,"Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications.",0
1702,"One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.",0
1703,"Computer Science, known by its near synonyms, Computing, Computer Studies, Information Technology (IT) and Information and Computing Technology (ICT), has been taught in UK schools since the days of batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students.",0
1704,"In 1981, the BBC produced a micro-computer and classroom network and Computer Studies became common for GCE O level students (11–16-year-old), and Computer Science to A level students.",0
1705,"Its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the National Curriculum, for Key Stage 3 & 4.",0
1706,"In September 2014 it became an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.In the US, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured.",0
1707,"According to a 2010 report by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula, and several others are following.",0

1715,"Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill.",0
1716,"On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.",0
1717,"It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.",0
1718,The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.,0
1719,"The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).",0
1720,"Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.",0
1721,"Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.",0
1722,"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.",0
1723,"Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas.",0
1724,The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.,0

1727,"The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.",0
1728,"In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith, a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.",0
1729,He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.,0
1730,"After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track.",0
1731,"In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each ""basket"" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.",0
1732,Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball.,0
1733,"These round balls from ""association football"" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.",0
1734,These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.,0
1735,"Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith.",0
1736,"(Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.)",0
1737,"The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use.",0
1738,"Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the ""bounce pass"" to teammates.",0
1739,Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement.,0
1740,Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.,0
1741,"Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.",0
1742,"A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through.",0
1743,"Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point.",0
1744,Whichever team got the most points won the game.,0
1745,"The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots.",0
1746,The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.,0
1747,"Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.",0
1748,"Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game.",0
1749,Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started.,0
1750,"Mahan suggested that it be called ""Naismith ball"", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game.",0
1751,"Naismith replied, ""We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it.""",0
1752,"The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players.",0
1753,"The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.",0
1754,"At the time, football was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11).",0
1755,"When winter weather got too icy to play football, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side.",0
1756,By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.,0
1757,"Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada.",0
1758,"By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools.",0
1759,"While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission.",0
1760,"However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void.",0

1926,"If women are playing, the official basketball size is 28.5 inches (72 cm) in circumference (size 6, or a ""285 ball"") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams).",0
1927,"In 3x3, a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams).",0
1928,"The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).",0
1929,The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession.,0
1930,"The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.",0
1931,"There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling.",0
1932,Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling.,0
1933,"A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble.",0
1934,"Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball.",0
1935,"A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it.",0
1936,A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.,0
1937,"The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist.",0
1938,"For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.",0
1939,"There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the ""key"") (3 seconds).",0
1940,These rules are designed to promote more offense.,0
1941,"Basket interference, or goaltending is a violation charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot.",0
1942,"This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot.",0
1943,"When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, the basket is awarded.",0
1944,"If an offensive player commits the infraction, the basket is cancelled.",0
1945,In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.,0
1946,An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul.,0
1947,"These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well.",0
1948,"Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful.",0
1949,"One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket.",0
1950,"The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy.",0
1951,"The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.",0
1952,"There is a second category of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct.",0
1953,"These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time.",0
1954,Repeated incidents can result in disqualification.,0
1955,A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA).,0
1956,"In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.",0
1957,"If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league.",0
1958,"In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made.",0
1959,"This is called shooting ""one-and-one"".",0
1960,"If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.",0
1961,"When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.",0
1962,"After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be ""in the bonus"".",0
1963,"On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading ""Bonus"" or ""Penalty"" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team.",0
1964,(Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.),0
1965,"If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.",0
1966,"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot.",0
1967,"A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.",0
1968,"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point.",0
1969,"In combination with a regular shot, this is called a ""three-point play"" or ""four-point play"" (or more colloquially, an ""and one"") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).",0
1970,"Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball.",0
1971,"During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used.",0
1972,"In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including Mike Krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball, where big guys are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it.",0
1973,"Popular descriptions of positions include:
Point guard (often called the ""1"") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.",0
1974,"Shooting guard (the ""2"") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.",0
1975,"Small forward (the ""3"") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.",0
1976,"Power forward (the ""4""): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).",0
1977,"Center (the ""5""): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.",0
1978,The above descriptions are flexible.,0
1979,"For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players.",0
1980,"While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.",0
1981,There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense.,0
1982,"In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court.",0
1983,"Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap.",0
1984,"In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.",0
1985,"Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball.",0
1986,A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut.,0
1987,"A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick.",0
1988,"The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket.",0
1989,"Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket.",0
1990,Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable.,0
1991,"On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.",0
1992,"Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.",0
1993,"Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket.",0
1994,"A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball.",0
1995,The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.,0
1996,"The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through.",0
1997,Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.,0
1998,"The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended.",0
1999,Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.,0
2000,The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot.,0
2001,Both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot.,0
2002,In a set shot the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor; this is typically used for free throws.,0
2003,"For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump.",0
2004,"This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.",0
2005,Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.,0
2006,Another common shot is called the lay-up.,0
2007,"This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to ""lay"" the ball ""up"" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll).",0
2008,"The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.",0
2009,"Another shot that is becoming common is the ""circus shot"".",0
2010,"The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.",0
2011,"A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.",0
2012,A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball.,0
2013,"A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.",0
2014,"The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.",0
2015,"The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard.",0
2016,"This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.",0
2017,"There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.",0
2018,"The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.",0
2019,A pass is a method of moving the ball between players.,0
2020,Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.,0
2021,A staple pass is the chest pass.,0
2022,The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest.,0
2023,A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.,0
2024,Another type of pass is the bounce pass.,0
2025,"Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver.",0
2026,The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver.,0
2027,"The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation).",0
2028,"Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.",0
2029,The overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender.,0
2030,The ball is released while over the passer's head.,0
2031,The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound.,0
2032,The next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass.,0
2033,The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept.,0
2034,Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball.,0
2035,A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate.,0
2036,This is called a no-look pass.,0
2037,"Another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate.",0
2038,"Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.",0
2039,Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball.,0
2040,"To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.",0
2041,"When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball.",0
2042,It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.,0
2043,"Good dribblers (or ""ball handlers"") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to ""steal"" the ball.",0
2044,"Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against.",0
2045,"This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.",0
2046,"A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location.",0
2047,"By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.",0
2048,"A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball.",0
2049,"In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending.",0
2050,"It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim.",0
2051,Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim.,0
2052,"After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.",0
2053,"To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released.",0
2054,"Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking.",0
2055,Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions.,0
2056,"However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.",0
2057,"At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and most women above 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m).",0
2058,"Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players.",0
2059,Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or taller.,0
2060,Most centers are over 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) tall.,0
2061,"According to a survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), with the average weight being close to 222 pounds (101 kg).",0
2062,"The tallest players ever in the NBA were Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, who were both 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m) tall.",0
2063,"At 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m), Margo Dydek was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA.",0
2064,The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is Muggsy Bogues at 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m).,0
2065,Other short players have thrived at the pro level.,0
2066,"Anthony ""Spud"" Webb was just 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) tall, but had a 42-inch (1.1 m) vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping.",0
2067,"While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.",0
2068,Players regularly inflate their height.,0
2069,"Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players.",0
2070,"Charles Barkley stated; ""I've been measured at 6-5, 6-4 ​3⁄4.",0
2071,"But I started in college at 6-6.""",0
2072,"Sam Smith, a former writer from The Chicago Tribune, said: ""We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out.",0
2073,"But you use that height, and the player gets mad.",0
2074,And then you hear from his agent.,0
2075,"Or you file your story with the right height, and the copy desk changes it because they have the 'official' N.B.A.",0
2076,"media guide, which is wrong.",0
2077,"So you sort of go along with the joke.""",0
2078,"In the NBA, there is no standard on whether a player's listed height uses their measurement with shoes on or without.",0
2079,"The NBA Draft Combine, which most players attend before the draft, provides both measurements.",0
2080,"Thereafter, a player's team is solely responsible for their listed height, which can vary depending on the process selected.Notable players who overstated their height include:

Kobe Bryant whose listed height is 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), while his actual height is 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m)
Charles Barkley whose listed height is 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), while his actual height is just under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m)
Kevin Love whose listed height is 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m), while his actual height is just under 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m)
Jason Collins whose listed height is 7 feet 0 inches (2.13 m), while his actual height is 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m)
Dwight Howard whose listed height is 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m), while his actual height is 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m)On rare occasions, some players will understate their actual heights, not to be repositioned.",0
2081,"One example is Kevin Durant, whose listed height is 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m), while his actual height is 7 feet 0 inches (2.13 m).",0
2082,"Durant's reasoning was, ""Really, that's the prototypical size for a small forward.",0
2083,"Anything taller than that, and they'll start saying, 'Ah, he's a power forward.""",0
2084,"Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball and basket).",0
2085,"Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences.",0
2086,"Other variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.",0
2087,"There are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including Wheelchair basketball, Water basketball, Beach basketball, Slamball, Streetball and Unicycle basketball.",0
2088,"An earlier version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was Six-on-six basketball.",0
2089,Horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m).,0
2090,"The sport is like a combination of polo, rugby, and basketball.",0
2091,"There is even a form played on donkeys known as Donkey basketball, but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.",0
2092,"Perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the half-court game, played in informal settings without referees or strict rules.",0
2093,"Only one basket is used, and the ball must be ""taken back"" or ""cleared"" – passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other.",0
2094,"Half-court games require less cardiovascular stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court.",0
2095,"Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.",0
2096,"Half-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3.",0
2097,"The latter variation is gradually gaining official recognition as 3x3, originally known as FIBA 33.",0
2098,"It was first tested at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games in Macau and the first official tournaments were held at the 2009 Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Youth Olympics, both in Singapore.",0
2099,"The first FIBA 3x3 Youth World Championships were held in Rimini, Italy in 2011, with the first FIBA 3x3 World Championships for senior teams following a year later in Athens.",0
2100,The sport is highly tipped to become an Olympic sport as early as 2016.,0
2101,"In the summer of 2017, the BIG3 basketball league, a professional 3x3 half court basketball league that features former NBA players, began.",0
2102,The BIG3 features several rule variants including a four-point field goal.,0
2103,"There are also other basketball sports, such as:

One-on-One - It is a variation in which two players will use only a small section of the court (often no more than a half of a court) and compete to play the ball into a single hoop.",0
2104,Such games tend to emphasize individual dribbling and ball stealing skills over shooting and team play.,0
2105,"Water basketball - Water basketball, played in a swimming pool, merges basketball and water polo rules.",0
2106,"Beach basketball - A modified version of basketball, played on beaches, was invented by Philip Bryant.",0
2107,"Beach basketball is played in a circular court with no backboard on the goal, no out-of-bounds rule with the ball movement to be done via passes or 21/2 steps, as dribbling is next to impossible on a soft surface.",0
2108,"Beach basketball has grown to a very popular, widespread competitive sport.",0
2109,15 Annual World Championships have been organized.,0
2110,Dunk Hoops - Dunk Hoops (a.k.a.,0
2111,"Dunk Ball) is a variation of the game of basketball, played on basketball hoops with lowered (under basketball regulation 10 feet) rims.",0
2112,It originated when the popularity of the slam dunk grew and was developed to create better chances for dunks with lowered rims and using altered goaltending rules.,0
2113,"Slamball - Slamball is full-contact basketball, with trampolines.",0
2114,"Points are scored by playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified.",0
2115,"The main differences from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and backboard are four trampolines set into the floor, which serve to propel players to great heights for slam dunks.",0
2116,The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams.,0
2117,"Streetball - Streetball is a less formal variant of basketball, played on playgrounds and in gymnasiums across the world.",0
2118,"Often only one half of the court is used, but otherwise, the rules of the game are very similar to those of basketball.",0
2119,"The number of participants in a game, or a run, may range from one defender and one person on offense (known as one on one) to two full teams of five each.",0
2120,"Streetball is a very popular game worldwide, and some cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, such as midnight basketball.",0
2121,Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments.,0
2122,"Unicycle basketball - Unicycle basketball is played using a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with the same rules, for example, one must dribble the ball while riding.",0
2123,"There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well, for example, a player must have at least one foot on a pedal when in-bounding the ball.",0
2124,"Unicycle basketball is usually played using 24"" or smaller unicycles, and using plastic pedals, both to preserve the court and the players' shins.",0
2125,"In North America, popular unicycle basketball games are organized.Spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:

Ringball, a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball, has been played since 1907.",0

2128,Australia New Zealand champions (so called ANZ Championship) is very famous in Australia and New Zealand as the premier netball league.,0
2129,"Basketball has been adopted by various social groups, which have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules.",0
2130,Such socialized forms of basketball include the following.,0
2131,"Basketball is played widely casually in schools and colleges where fun, entertainment and camaraderie rule rather than winning a game.",0
2132,"Basketball Schools and Academies, where students are trained in developing basketball fundamentals, undergo fitness and endurance exercises and learn various basketball skills.",0
2133,"Basketball students learn proper ways of passing, ball handling, dribbling, shooting from various distances, rebounding, offensive moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball rules and basketball ethics.",0
2134,"Also popular are the basketball camps organized for various occasions, often to get prepared for basketball events, and basketball clinics for improving skills.",0

2140,Wheelchair basketball - A sport based on basketball but designed for disabled people in wheelchairs and considered one of the major disabled sports practiced.There is a functional classification system that is used to help determine if the wheelchair basketball player classification system reflects the existing differences in the performance of elite female players.,0
2141,what this system does is it gives an analysis of the players' functional resources through field-testing and game observation.,0

2170,"American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end.",0
2171,"The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves.",0
2172,"The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive.",0
2173,Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.,0
2174,The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.,0
2175,"American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby.",0
2176,"The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time.",0
2177,"A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the ""Father of American Football"", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs.",0
2178,"Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone and specified the size and shape of the football.",0
2179,"The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game (although their rules were developed independently from that of Camp's).",0
2180,Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football.,0
2181,The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.,0
2182,American football is the most popular sport in the United States.,0
2183,"The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high school and youth football.",0
2184,"As of 2012, nearly 1.1 million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually.",0
2185,"The National Football League, the most popular American football league, has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world.",0
2186,"Its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world.",0
2187,The league has an annual revenue of around US$13 billion.,0
2188,"Other professional leagues exist worldwide, but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports like baseball or basketball.",0
2189,"In the United States, American football is referred to as ""football"".",0
2190,"The term ""football"" was officially established in the rulebook for the 1876 college football season, when the sport first shifted from soccer-style rules to rugby-style rules.",0
2191,"Although it could easily have been called ""rugby"" at this point, Harvard, one of the primary proponents of the rugby-style game, compromised and did not request the name of the sport be changed to ""rugby"".",0
2192,"The terms ""gridiron"" or ""American football"" are favored in English-speaking countries where other types of football are popular, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.",0
2193,American football evolved from the sports of soccer and rugby.,0
2194,"Rugby, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, between Rutgers and Princeton, two college teams.",0
2195,They consisted of 25 players each and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried.,0
2196,"It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal.",0
2197,Rutgers won the game 6–4.,0
2198,Collegiate play continued for several years with matches played using the rules of the host school.,0
2199,"Representatives of Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873, to create a standard set of rules for use by all schools.",0
2200,"Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet (122 m × 76 m) were specified.",0
2201,"Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.",0
2202,"After playing McGill University using both Canadian and American rules, the Harvard players preferred the Canadian style of having only 11 men on the field, running the ball without having to be chased by an opponent, the forward pass, tackling, and using an oblong instead of a round ball.An 1875 Harvard–Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two Princeton athletes who were impressed by it.",0
2203,"They introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the Professional Football Researchers Association compared to ""selling refrigerators to Eskimos"".",0
2204,"Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system.",0
2205,"These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879.",0
2206,"Yale player Walter Camp, now regarded as the ""Father of American Football"", secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap to replace the chaotic and inconsistent scrum.",0
2207,The introduction of the snap resulted in an unexpected consequence.,0
2208,"Prior to the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position.",0
2209,"However, a group of Princeton players realized that as the snap was uncontested, they could now hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring.",0
2210,"In 1881, in a game between Yale and Princeton, both teams used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records.",0
2211,"Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0–0 tie.",0
2212,"This ""block game"" proved extremely unpopular with both teams' spectators and fans.A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered.",0
2213,"However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three downs, or tackles, to advance the ball 5 yards (4.6 m).",0
2214,Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team.,0
2215,"This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a gridiron in appearance.",0
2216,"Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to 110 by 53 1⁄3 yards (100.6 m × 48.8 m) and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a goal following a touchdown, and five for a goal from the field.",0
2217,"Additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized, and a static line of scrimmage was instituted.",0
2218,"Despite these new rules, football remained a violent sport.",0
2219,Dangerous mass-formations like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths.,0
2220,A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made.,0
2221,"In response, 62 colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905.",0
2222,"These proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).The legal forward pass was introduced in 1906, although its impact was initially minimal due to the restrictions placed on its use.",0
2223,The idea of a 40-yard-wider field was opposed by Harvard due to the size of the new Harvard Stadium.,0
2224,Other rule changes introduced that year included the reduction of playing time from 70 to 60 minutes and an increase of the distance required for a first down from 5 to 10 yards (4.6 to 9.1 m).,0
2225,"To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the neutral zone was created along the width of the football before the snap.",0
2226,Scoring was also adjusted: points awarded for field goals were reduced to three in 1909 and points for touchdowns were raised to six in 1912.,0
2227,"The field was also shortened to 100 yards (91 m) long, but two 10-yard-long (9.1 m) end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball 10 yards (9.1 m).",0
2228,"The roughing the passer penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field in 1918.",0
2229,"On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid $500 to play a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association in a match against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club.",0
2230,"This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money.",0
2231,"Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not prohibited outright.Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school.",0
2232,"The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems.",0
2233,"This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.",0
2234,"By 1922, the NFL had established itself as America's premier professional football league.The dominant form of football at the time was played at the collegiate level.",0
2235,"The upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925, however, when an NFL team, the Pottsville Maroons, defeated a team of Notre Dame all-stars in an exhibition game.",0
2236,A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to distinguish itself further from the college game during the late 1930s.,0
2237,"Football, in general, became increasingly popular following the 1958 NFL Championship game, a match between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants that is still referred to as the ""Greatest Game Ever Played"".",0
2238,"The game, a 23–17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major impact on the popularity of the sport.",0
2239,"This, along with the innovations introduced by the new American Football League (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.The rival AFL arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance.",0
2240,"The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the ABC television network.",0
2241,The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league.,0
2242,"Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to professional football in the United States: official time was kept on a scoreboard clock rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL.",0
2243,The AFL also signed several star college players who had also been drafted by NFL teams.,0
2244,"Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record $437,000 contract (equivalent to $2.76 million in 2019).",0
2245,"A five-year, $40 million  NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league.",0
2246,"The bidding war for players ended in 1966 when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that took full effect in 1970.",0
2247,"This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league.",0
2248,This championship game began play at the end of the 1966 season.,0
2249,"Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl.College football maintained a tradition of postseason bowl games.",0
2250,Each bowl game was associated with a particular conference and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference.,0
2251,"This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences.",0
2252,Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football.,0
2253,"The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994.",0
2254,"This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).",0
2255,"The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).",0
2256,A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each.,0
2257,Playing with more on the field is punishable by a penalty.,0
2258,"Teams may substitute any number of their players between downs; this ""platoon"" system replaced the original system, which featured limited substitution rules, and has resulted in teams utilizing specialized offensive, defensive and special teams units.Individual players in a football game must be designated with a uniform number between 1 and 99.",0
2259,"NFL teams are required to number their players by a league-approved numbering system, and any exceptions must be approved by the Commissioner.",0
2260,"NCAA and NFHS teams are ""strongly advised"" to number their offensive players according to a league-suggested numbering scheme.Although the sport is played almost exclusively by men, women are eligible to play in high school, college, and professional football.",0
2261,"No woman has ever played in the NFL, but women have played in high school and college football games.",0
2262,"In 2018, 1,100 of the 225,000 players in Pop Warner Little Scholars youth football were girls, and around 11% of the 5.5 million Americans who report playing tackle football are female according to the Sports and Fitness Industry Association.",0
2263,Women can also serve as officials; Sarah Thomas became the NFL's first female official in 2015.,0
2264,The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown.,0
2265,The offensive team must line up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball.,0
2266,An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line.,0
2267,"Players can line up temporarily in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they report the change immediately to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change.",0
2268,"Neither team's players, except the center (C), are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped.",0
2269,Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.,0
2270,"The main backfield positions are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB).",0
2271,The quarterback is the leader of the offense.,0
2272,Either the quarterback or a coach calls the plays.,0
2273,Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up.,0
2274,"The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.The primary role of the halfback, also known as the running back or tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays.",0
2275,Halfbacks may also serve as receivers.,0
2276,"Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.The offensive line (OL) consists of several players whose primary function is to block members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays.",0
2277,"The leader of the offensive line is the center, who is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play.",0
2278,"On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.",0
2279,The principal receivers are the wide receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE).,0
2280,"Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside the line.",0
2281,"The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays.",0
2282,Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.,0
2283,The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by tackling the ball carrier or by forcing turnovers (interceptions or fumbles).The defensive line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT).,0
2284,"Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends.",0
2285,"The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles are to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.",0
2286,Linebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield.,0
2287,They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB).,0
2288,Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays.,0
2289,"Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.The defensive backfield, often called the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S).",0
2290,Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS).,0
2291,"Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite a receiver to be able to cover them.",0
2292,Safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary.,0
2293,Safeties are the last line of defense and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.,0
2294,The special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays.,0
2295,"The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball tries to execute field goal (FG) attempts, punts and kickoffs, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.Three positions are specific to the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS).",0
2296,"The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker.",0
2297,"There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee.",0
2298,"The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).The positions specific to punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, upback and gunner.",0
2299,"The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground.",0
2300,"Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR)—the player who catches the punt.",0
2301,"Upbacks line up a short distance behind the line of scrimmage, providing additional protection to the punter.",0
2302,"In football, the winner is the team that has scored more points at the end of the game.",0
2303,There are multiple ways to score in a football game.,0
2304,"The touchdown (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football.",0
2305,"A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered in the opposing team's end zone.",0
2306,"The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.",0
2307,"A PAT is most commonly attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play.",0
2308,"If a PAT is scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, typically called the extra point.",0
2309,"If it is scored by what would normally be a touchdown it is worth two points, typically called the two-point conversion.",0
2310,"In general, the extra point is almost always successful while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.A field goal (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is placekicked or dropkicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.",0
2311,"After a PAT attempt or successful field goal, the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.A safety is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in their own end zone.",0
2312,"Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.",0
2313,"In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a free kick.",0
2314,Football games are played on a rectangular field that measures 120 yards (110 m) long and 53 1⁄3 yards (48.8 m) wide.,0
2315,Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known as the end lines and sidelines.,0
2316,Goal lines are marked 10 yards (9.1 m) inward from each end line.Weighted pylons are placed the sidelines on the inside corner of the intersections with the goal lines and end lines.,0
2317,White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone.,0
2318,"Inbound lines, or hash marks, are short parallel lines that mark off 1-yard (0.91 m) increments.",0
2319,"Yard lines, which can run the width of the field, are marked every 5 yards (4.6 m).",0
2320,A one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play.,0
2321,Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.Goalposts are located at the center of the plane of the two end lines.,0
2322,"The crossbar of these posts is 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar 18 feet 6 inches (5.64 m) apart for professional and collegiate play, and 23 feet 4 inches (7.11 m) apart for high school play.",0
2323,"The uprights extend vertically 35 feet (11 m) on professional fields, a minimum of 10 yards (9.1 m) on college fields, and a minimum of 10 feet (3.0 m) on high school fields.",0
2324,"Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are normally placed at the tip of each upright as indicators of wind strength and direction.The football itself is an oval ball, similar to the balls used in rugby or Australian rules football.",0
2325,"At all levels of play, the football is inflated to 12 1⁄2 to 13 1⁄2 pounds per square inch (86 to 93 kPa) and weighs 14 to 15 ounces (400 to 430 g); beyond that, the exact dimensions vary slightly.",0
2326,"In professional play the ball has a long axis of 11 to 11 1⁄4 inches (28 to 29 cm), a long circumference of 28 to 28 1⁄2 inches (71 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of 21 to 21 1⁄4 inches (53 to 54 cm).",0
2327,"In college and high school play the ball has a long axis of 10 7⁄8 to 11 7⁄16 inches (27.6 to 29.1 cm), a long circumference of 27 3⁄4 to 28 1⁄2 inches (70 to 72 cm), and a short circumference of 20 3⁄4 to 21 1⁄4 inches (53 to 54 cm).",0
2328,Football games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided into two halves of 30 minutes and four quarters of 15 minutes.,0
2329,High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two halves of 24 minutes and four quarters of 12 minutes.,0
2330,"The two halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are followed by a short break.",0
2331,"Before the game starts, the referee and each team's captain meet at midfield for a coin toss.",0
2332,"The visiting team can call either ""heads"" or ""tails""; the winner of the toss chooses whether to receive or kick off the ball or which goal they wish to defend.",0
2333,They can defer their choice until the second half.,0
2334,"Unless the winning team decides to defer, the losing team chooses the option the winning team did not select—to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half.",0
2335,"Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game allows the other team to choose which goal to defend.",0
2336,Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters.,0
2337,"If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.Games last longer than their defined length due to play stoppages—the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours.",0
2338,Time in a football game is measured by the game clock.,0
2339,"An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official.",0
2340,A separate play clock is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed.,0
2341,"If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense.",0
2342,The play clock is set 25 seconds after certain administrative stoppages in play and to 40 seconds when play is proceeding without such stoppages.,0
2343,There are two main ways the offense can advance the ball: running and passing.,0
2344,"In a typical play, the center passes the ball backwards and between their legs to the quarterback in a process known as the snap.",0
2345,"The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball, or runs with it.",0
2346,The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out-of-bounds or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it.,0
2347,A forward pass can be legally attempted only if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage; only one forward pass can be attempted per down.,0
2348,"Like in rugby, players can also pass the ball backwards at any point during a play.",0
2349,"In the NFL, a down also ends immediately if the runner's helmet comes off.The offense is given a series of four plays, known as downs.",0
2350,"If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs.",0
2351,"If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense.",0
2352,"In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from farther down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might attempt to score a field goal instead.",0
2353,"A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements.",0
2354,"On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.",0
2355,"There are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free kicks.",0
2356,"The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts the first and third quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal; the safety kick follows a safety.On a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play.",0
2357,The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked.,0
2358,"If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or a tee; a holder may be used in either case.",0
2359,"On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line.",0
2360,"They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play.",0
2361,Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball.,0
2362,"The ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts.",0
2363,Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points.,0
2364,"The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop kick.",0
2365,"Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage.",0
2366,"If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched.",0
2367,The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball.,0
2368,"The receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch, which prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver.",0
2369,The play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.,0
2370,Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock.,0
2371,"All officials carry a whistle and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white.",0
2372,Each carries a weighted yellow flag that is thrown to the ground to signal that a foul has been called.,0
2373,An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.,0
2374,"The seven officials (of a standard seven-man crew; lower levels of play up to the college level use fewer officials) on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:
The referee is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs.",0
2375,"The referee is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any rule interpretations in discussions among the other officials.",0
2376,"The referee announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected.",0
2377,The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of the quarterback.,0
2378,"In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a play from scrimmage.",0
2379,"The umpire is positioned in the defensive backfield, except in the NFL, where the umpire is positioned lateral to the referee on the opposite side of the formation.",0
2380,The umpire watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field before the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays.,0
2381,The umpire monitors contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties.,0
2382,"The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.",0
2383,"The back judge is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire.",0
2384,"The back judge ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a pass interference violation occurred.",0
2385,"The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time between each play, when a visible play clock is not used.",0
2386,The head linesman/down judge is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage.,0
2387,The head linesman/down judge watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls.,0
2388,"The head linesman/down judge also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.",0
2389,The side judge is positioned twenty yards downfield of the head linesman.,0
2390,The side judge mainly duplicates the functions of the field judge.,0
2391,"On field goal and extra point attempts, the side judge is positioned lateral to the umpire.",0
2392,"The line judge is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman.",0
2393,"They supervise player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing.",0
2394,The line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime.,0
2395,"In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half.",0
2396,"If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.",0
2397,The field judge is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line judge.,0
2398,"The field judge monitors and controls the play clock, counts the number of defensive players on the field and watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive players.",0
2399,"The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of scrimmage.",0
2400,"On field goal and extra point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the upright opposite the back judge.",0
2401,The center judge is an eighth official used only in the top level of college football.,0
2402,"The center judge stands lateral to the referee, the same way the umpire does in the NFL.",0
2403,"The center judge is responsible for spotting the football after each play and has many of the same responsibilities as the referee, except announcing penalties.Another set of officials, the chain crew, are responsible for moving the chains.",0
2404,"The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down.",0
2405,"The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure.",0
2406,"A typical chain crew will have at least three people—two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker.",0
2407,"The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball.",0
2408,"The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.",0
2409,"Football is a full-contact sport, and injuries are relatively common.",0
2410,"Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players.",0
2411,"To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment.",0
2412,"At a minimum players must wear a football helmet and a set of shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards.",0
2413,"Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities.",0
2414,"The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions.Repeated concussions (and possibly sub-concussive head impacts) can increase a person's risk in later life for CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression.",0
2415,"Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures.",0
2416,"Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's ""Heads Up Football"" program aims to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, the proper way to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact.",0
2417,"However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.A 2018 study performed by the VA Boston Healthcare System and the Boston University School of Medicine found that tackle football before age 12 was correlated with earlier onset of symptoms of CTE, but not with symptom severity.",0
2418,"More specifically, each year a player played tackle football under age 12 predicted earlier onset of cognitive, behavioral, and mood problems by an average of two and a half years.",0
2419,The National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are the most popular football leagues in the United States.,0
2420,The National Football League was founded in 1920 and has since become the largest and most popular sport in the United States.,0

2426,Division I football is further divided into two subdivisions: the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).,0
2427,"The champions of each level of play are determined through NCAA-sanctioned playoff systems; while the champion of Division I-FBS was historically determined by various polls and ranking systems, the subdivision adopted a four-team playoff system in 2014.High school football is the most popular sport in the United States played by boys; over 1.1 million boys participated in the sport from 2007 to 2008 according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).",0

2431,"One such league, the XFL, is currently operating as of 2020.",0
2432,"The most successful league to directly compete with the NFL was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969.",0
2433,"The AFL became a significant rival in 1964 before signing a five-year, US$36 million television deal with NBC.",0
2434,"AFL teams began signing NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL.",0
2435,"The two leagues merged in the 1970 season, and all the AFL teams joined the NFL.",0
2436,"An earlier league, the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), was in play from 1946 to 1949.",0
2437,"After it had dissolved, two AAFC teams, the Cleveland Browns and the San Francisco 49ers, became members of the NFL; another member, the Baltimore Colts joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.Other attempts to start rival leagues since the AFL merged with the NFL in 1970 have been far less successful, as professional football salaries and the NFL's television contracts began to escalate out of the reach of competitors and the NFL covered more of the larger cities.",0
2438,"The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced such severe monetary issues it could not pay its players.",0
2439,"In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before the season could be completed.",0
2440,The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985.,0
2441,"Originally not intended as a rival league, the entry of owners who sought marquee talent and to challenge the NFL led to an escalation in salaries and ensuing financial losses.",0
2442,"A subsequent US$1.5 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only $1 in damages, which was automatically tripled to $3 under antitrust law.",0
2443,The original XFL was created in 2001 by Vince McMahon and lasted for only one season.,0
2444,"Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN, and high expectations, the XFL suffered from low quality of play and poor reception for its use of tawdry professional wrestling gimmicks, which caused initially high ratings and attendance to collapse.",0
2445,"(The current XFL, also owned by McMahon, does not include those gimmicks.)",0
2446,The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009 but folded after suspending its 2012 season amid declining interest and lack of major television coverage.,0
2447,"The Alliance of American Football lasted less than one season, unable to keep investors.",0
2448,"American football leagues exist throughout the world, but the game has yet to achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball.",0
2449,"It is not an Olympic sport, but it was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Summer Olympics.",0
2450,"At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier.",0

2458,The IFAF also organizes the annual International Bowl game.,0
2459,The IFAF has received provisional recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).,0
2460,Several major obstacles hinder the IFAF goal of achieving status as an Olympic sport.,0

2463,American football also has an issue with a lack of global visibility.,0
2464,"Nigel Melville, the CEO of USA Rugby, noted that ""American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally.""",0

2517,"Although both games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures 150 by 65 yards (137 by 59 m), including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards), teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone.",0

3969,A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.,0
3970,"A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.",0
3971,"The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice.",0
3972,"A common short form of the term is phone, which has been in use since the early 20th century.",0
3973,"In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice.",0
3974,"This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households.",0
3975,The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.,0
3976,"In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone.",0
3977,The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.,0
3978,The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.,0
3979,"The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker.",0
3980,"Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously.",0
3981,The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.,0
3982,"Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards.",0
3983,"These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network.",0
3984,"For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century.",0
3985,Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.,0
3986,In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost.,0
3987,Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.,0
3988,"Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs.",0
3989,"A traditional landline telephone system, also known as plain old telephone service (POTS), commonly carries both control and audio signals on the same twisted pair (C in diagram) of insulated wires, the telephone line.",0
3990,"The control and signaling equipment consists of three components, the ringer, the hookswitch, and a dial.",0
3991,"The ringer, or beeper, light or other device (A7), alerts the user to incoming calls.",0
3992,The hookswitch signals to the central office that the user has picked up the handset to either answer a call or initiate a call.,0
3993,"A dial, if present, is used by the subscriber to transmit a telephone number to the central office when initiating a call.",0
3994,"Until the 1960s dials used almost exclusively the rotary technology, which was replaced by dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) with pushbutton telephones (A4).",0
3995,A major expense of wire-line telephone service is the outside wire plant.,0
3996,Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on a single pair of wires.,0
3997,A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair.,0
3998,The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance.,0
3999,The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length.,0
4000,Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8).,0
4001,"The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion.",0
4002,Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.,0
4003,"The landline telephone contains a switchhook (A4) and an alerting device, usually a ringer (A7), that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is ""on hook"" (i.e.",0
4004,"the switch (A4) is open), and other components which are connected when the phone is ""off hook"".",0
4005,"The off-hook components include a transmitter (microphone, A2), a receiver (speaker, A1), and other circuits for dialing, filtering (A3), and amplification.",0
4006,"The place a telephone call, the calling party picks up the telephone's handset, thereby operating a lever which closes the hook switch (A4).",0
4007,"This powers the telephone by connecting the transmission hybrid transformer, as well as the transmitter (microphone) and receiver (speaker) to the line.",0
4008,"In this off-hook state, the telephone circuitry has a low resistance of typically than 300 ohms, which causes the flow of direct current (DC) in the line (C) from the telephone exchange.",0
4009,"The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends dial tone to indicate its readiness.",0
4010,"On a modern push-button telephone, the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the destination, the called party.",0
4011,The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that sends DTMF tones to the exchange.,0
4012,"A rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing, sending electrical pulses, that the exchange counts to decode each digit of the telephone number.",0
4013,"If the called party's line is available, the terminating exchange applies an intermittent alternating current (AC) ringing signal of 40 to 90 volts to alert the called party of the incoming call.",0
4014,"If the called party's line is in use, however, the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party.",0
4015,"If the called party's line is in use but subscribes to call waiting service, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate another call.",0
4016,"The electromechanical ringer of a telephone (A7) is connected to the line through a capacitor (A6), which blocks direct current and passes the alternating current of the ringing power.",0
4017,"The telephone draws no current when it is on hook, while a DC voltage is continually applied to the line.",0
4018,Exchange circuitry (D2) can send an alternating current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call.,0
4019,"In manual service exchange areas, before dial service was installed, telephones had hand-cranked magneto generators to generate a ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line.",0
4020,"When a landline telephone is inactive (on hook), the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use.",0
4021,"When a party initiates a call to this line, the exchange sends the ringing signal.",0
4022,"When the called party picks up the handset, they actuate a double-circuit switchhook (not shown) which may simultaneously disconnects the alerting device and connects the audio circuitry to the line.",0
4023,"This, in turn, draws direct current through the line, confirming that the called phone is now active.",0
4024,"The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal, and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange.",0
4025,The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook.,0
4026,"When a party hangs up, placing the handset back on the cradle or hook, direct current ceases in that line, signaling the exchange to disconnect the call.",0
4027,Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over trunk lines which establish connections between exchanges.,0
4028,"In modern telephone networks, fiber-optic cable and digital technology are often employed in such connections.",0
4029,Satellite technology may be used for communication over very long distances.,0
4030,"In most landline telephones, the transmitter and receiver (microphone and speaker) are located in the handset, although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure.",0
4031,"Powered by the line, the microphone (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm.",0
4032,"The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the coil of the receiver (A3).",0
4033,"The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver's diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter.",0
4034,"Along with the microphone and speaker, additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other.",0
4035,This is accomplished through a hybrid coil (A3).,0
4036,The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1).,0
4037,"Since the current path A8 – A3 has a far lower impedance than the microphone (A2), virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone.",0
4038,At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor-coil (A8-A3) branch and the microphone-coil (A2-A3) branch.,0
4039,The DC current through the resistor-coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal.,0
4040,"But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC  (in response to voice sounds) which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil's (A3) primary winding, which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding.",0
4041,"This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker, while the rest of the AC goes out through the phone line.",0
4042,"A lineman's handset is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network, and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components.",0
4043,"Before the development of the electric telephone, the term ""telephone"" was applied to other inventions, and not all early researchers of the electrical device called it ""telephone"".",0
4044,Perhaps the earliest use of the word for a communications system was the telephon created by Gottfried Huth in 1796.,0
4045,"Huth proposed an alternative to the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe in which the operators in the signalling towers would shout to each other by means of what he called ""speaking tubes"", but would now be called giant megaphones.",0
4046,"A communication device for sailing vessels called a ""telephone"" was invented by the captain John Taylor in 1844.",0
4047,"This instrument used four air horns to communicate with vessels in foggy weather.Johann Philipp Reis used the term in reference to his invention, commonly known as the Reis telephone, in c. 1860.",0
4048,His device appears to be the first device based on conversion of sound into electrical impulses.,0
4049,The term telephone was adopted into the vocabulary of many languages.,0
4050,"It is derived from the Greek: τῆλε, tēle, ""far"" and φωνή, phōnē, ""voice"", together meaning ""distant voice"".",0
4051,Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed.,0
4052,"As with other influential inventions such as radio, television, the light bulb, and the computer, several inventors pioneered experimental work on voice transmission over a wire and improved on each other's ideas.",0
4053,New controversies over the issue still arise from time to time.,0
4054,"Charles Bourseul, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray, amongst others, have all been credited with the invention of the telephone.Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be awarded a patent for the electric telephone by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in March 1876.",0
4055,"Before Bell's patent, the telephone transmitted sound in a way that was similar to the telegraph.",0
4056,"This method used vibrations and circuits to send electrical pulses, but was missing key features.",0
4057,"Bell found that this method produced a sound through intermittent currents, but in order for the telephone to work a fluctuating current reproduced sounds the best.",0
4058,"The fluctuating currents became the basis for the working telephone, creating Bell's patent.",0
4059,"That first patent by Bell was the master patent of the telephone, from which other patents for electric telephone devices and features flowed.",0
4060,The Bell patents were forensically victorious and commercially decisive.,0
4061,"In 1876, shortly after Bell's patent application, Hungarian engineer Tivadar Puskás proposed the telephone switch, which allowed for the formation of telephone exchanges, and eventually networks.In the United Kingdom the blower is used as a slang term for a telephone.",0
4062,The term came from navy slang for a speaking tube.,0
4063,"1844: Innocenzo Manzetti first mooted the idea of a ""speaking telegraph"" or telephone.",0
4064,"Use of the ""speaking telegraph"" and ""sound telegraph"" monikers would eventually be replaced by the newer, distinct name, ""telephone"".",0
4065,"26 August 1854: Charles Bourseul published an article in the magazine L'Illustration (Paris): ""Transmission électrique de la parole"" (electric transmission of speech), describing a ""make-and-break"" type telephone transmitter later created by Johann Reis.",0
4066,26 October 1861: Johann Philipp Reis (1834–1874) publicly demonstrated the Reis telephone before the Physical Society of Frankfurt.,0
4067,Reis' telephone was not limited to musical sounds.,0
4068,"Reis also used his telephone to transmit the phrase ""Das Pferd frisst keinen Gurkensalat"" (""The horse does not eat cucumber salad"").",0
4069,"22 August 1865, La Feuille d'Aoste reported ""It is rumored that English technicians to whom Mr. Manzetti illustrated his method for transmitting spoken words on the telegraph wire intend to apply said invention in England on several private telegraph lines"".",0
4070,"However telephones would not be demonstrated there until 1876, with a set of telephones from Bell.",0
4071,28 December 1871: Antonio Meucci files patent caveat No.,0
4072,"3335 in the U.S. Patent Office titled ""Sound Telegraph"", describing communication of voice between two people by wire.",0
4073,"A 'patent caveat' was not an invention patent award, but only an unverified notice filed by an individual that he or she intends to file a regular patent application in the future.",0
4074,"1874: Meucci, after having renewed the caveat for two years does not renew it again, and the caveat lapses.",0
4075,"6 April 1875: Bell's U.S. Patent 161,739 ""Transmitters and Receivers for Electric Telegraphs"" is granted.",0
4076,This uses multiple vibrating steel reeds in make-break circuits.,0
4077,11 February 1876: Elisha Gray invents a liquid transmitter for use with a telephone but does not build one.,0
4078,14 February 1876: Gray files a patent caveat for transmitting the human voice through a telegraphic circuit.,0
4079,"14 February 1876: Alexander Graham Bell applies for the patent ""Improvements in Telegraphy"", for electromagnetic telephones using what is now called amplitude modulation (oscillating current and voltage) but which he referred to as ""undulating current"".",0
4080,19 February 1876: Gray is notified by the U.S. Patent Office of an interference between his caveat and Bell's patent application.,0
4081,Gray decides to abandon his caveat.,0
4082,"7 March 1876: Bell's U.S. patent 174,465 ""Improvement in Telegraphy"" is granted, covering ""the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically…by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound.""",0
4083,"10 March 1876: The first successful telephone transmission of clear speech using a liquid transmitter when Bell spoke into his device, ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.""",0
4084,and Watson heard each word distinctly.,0
4085,"30 January 1877: Bell's U.S. patent 186,787 is granted for an electromagnetic telephone using permanent magnets, iron diaphragms, and a call bell.",0
4086,27 April 1877: Edison files for a patent on a carbon (graphite) transmitter.,0
4087,"The patent 474,230 was granted 3 May 1892, after a 15-year delay because of litigation.",0
4088,"Edison was granted patent 222,390 for a carbon granules transmitter in 1879.",0
4089,Early telephones were technically diverse.,0
4090,"Some used a water microphone, some had a metal diaphragm that induced current in an electromagnet wound around a permanent magnet, and some were dynamic – their diaphragm vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or the coil vibrated the diaphragm.",0
4091,"The sound-powered dynamic variants survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications, where its ability to create its own electrical power was crucial.",0
4092,"Most, however, used the Edison/Berliner carbon transmitter, which was much louder than the other kinds, even though it required an induction coil which was an impedance matching transformer to make it compatible with the impedance of the line.",0
4093,"The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time the network was more important than the instrument.",0
4094,"Early telephones were locally powered, using either a dynamic transmitter or by the powering of a transmitter with a local battery.",0
4095,One of the jobs of outside plant personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery.,0
4096,"During the 20th century, telephones powered from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals became common.",0
4097,"Early telephones used a single wire for the subscriber's line, with ground return used to complete the circuit (as used in telegraphs).",0
4098,"The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one port opening for sound, with the user alternately listening and speaking (or rather, shouting) into the same hole.",0
4099,"Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive.",0
4100,"At first, the benefits of a telephone exchange were not exploited.",0
4101,"Instead telephones were leased in pairs to a subscriber, who had to arrange for a telegraph contractor to construct a line between them, for example between a home and a shop.",0
4102,Users who wanted the ability to speak to several different locations would need to obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones.,0
4103,"Western Union, already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential.",0
4104,Signalling began in an appropriately primitive manner.,0
4105,"The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter.",0
4106,"Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell in a ringer box, first operated over a second wire, and later over the same wire, but with a condenser (capacitor) in series with the bell coil to allow the AC ringer signal through while still blocking DC (keeping the phone ""on hook"").",0
4107,"Telephones connected to the earliest Strowger switch automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the knife switch, one for each telegraph key, one for the bell, one for the push-button and two for speaking.",0
4108,"Large wall telephones in the early 20th century usually incorporated the bell, and separate bell boxes for desk phones dwindled away in the middle of the century.",0
4109,Rural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had a magneto hand-cranked generator to produce a high voltage alternating signal to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the operator.,0
4110,Some local farming communities that were not connected to the main networks set up barbed wire telephone lines that exploited the existing system of field fences to transmit the signal.,0
4111,"In the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, packaged in three parts.",0
4112,"The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a ""candlestick"" for its shape.",0
4113,"When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a ""switchhook"".",0
4114,Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell.,0
4115,"With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone ""off the hook"".",0
4116,"In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery and magneto were in a separate bell box or ""ringer box"".",0
4117,"In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out-of-the-way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.",0
4118,"Cradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, now called a handset, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts.",0
4119,"They were larger than the ""candlestick"" and more popular.",0
4120,"Disadvantages of single-wire operation such as crosstalk and hum from nearby AC power wires had already led to the use of twisted pairs and, for long-distance telephones, four-wire circuits.",0
4121,Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place long-distance calls from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special soundproofed long-distance telephone booth furnished with the latest technology.,0
4122,"What turned out to be the most popular and longest-lasting physical style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's 202-type desk set.",0
4123,"A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit.",0
4124,"The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled.",0
4125,"In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop.",0
4126,"The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set.",0
4127,"The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle.",0
4128,"In the 1930s, telephone sets were developed that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box.",0
4129,"The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s in many areas enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s.",0
4130,"After World War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices.",0
4131,A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.,0
4132,"The invention of the transistor in 1947 dramatically changed the technology used in telephone systems and in the long-distance transmission networks, over the next several decades.",0
4133,"Along with the development of stored program control for electronic switching systems, and new transmission technologies, such as pulse-code modulation (PCM), telephony gradually evolved towards digital telephony, which improved the capacity, quality, and cost of the network.The development of digital data communications methods made it possible to digitize voice and transmit it as real-time data across computer networks and the Internet, giving rise to the field of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a term that reflects the methodology memorably.",0
4134,VoIP has proven to be a disruptive technology that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone network infrastructure.,0
4135,"By January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in Japan and South Korea had switched to this digital telephone service.",0
4136,"A January 2005 Newsweek article suggested that Internet telephony may be ""the next big thing.""",0
4137,The technology has spawned a new industry comprising many VoIP companies that offer services to consumers and businesses.,0
4138,"IP telephony uses high-bandwidth Internet connections and specialized customer premises equipment to transmit telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network.",0
4139,The customer equipment may be an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which translates the signals of a conventional analog telephone to packet-switched IP messages.,0
4140,"IP Phones have these function combined in standalone device, and computer softphone applications use microphone and headset devices of a personal computer.",0
4141,"While traditional analog telephones are typically powered from the central office through the telephone line, digital telephones require a local power supply.",0
4142,Internet-based digital service also requires special provisions to provide the service location to the emergency services when an emergency telephone number is called.,0
4143,"In 2002, only 10% of the world's population used mobile phones and by 2005 that percentage had risen to 46%.",0
4144,"By the end of 2009, there were a total of nearly 6 billion mobile and fixed-line telephone subscribers worldwide.",0
4145,This included 1.26 billion fixed-line subscribers and 4.6 billion mobile subscribers.,0

4202,"In addition to that award, Up and Toy Story 3 were also the second and third animated films, respectively, to be nominated for the more inclusive Academy Award for Best Picture (the first being Walt Disney Animation Studios' Beauty and the Beast in 1991).",0
4203,"On September 6, 2009, Pixar executives John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion award for Lifetime Achievement by the Venice Film Festival.",0
4204,"As part of the ceremony, the physical award was handed to Lucasfilm's founder, George Lucas.",0
4205,"Pixar got its start in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder, Alexander Schure, who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film.",0
4206,"Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab.",0
4207,"Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15  million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles.",0
4208,"Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal.",0
4209,"Francis Ford Coppola then invited Smith to his house for a three-day media conference, where Coppola and George Lucas shared their visions for the future of digital moviemaking.When Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm.",0
4210,"During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before joining the Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.",0
4211,"The Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT, where he was in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab.",0
4212,"He was then reunited with Smith, who also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm, and was made the director of the Graphics Group.",0
4213,"At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques—in particular, the invention of the alpha channel (by Catmull and Smith).",0
4214,"Over the next several years, the CGL would produce a few frames of an experimental film called The Works.",0
4215,"After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for ""renders everything you ever saw"") and developed several critical technologies for CG—including particle effects and various animation tools.",0
4216,"John Lasseter was hired to the Lucasfilm team for a week in late 1983 with the title ""interface designer""; he animated the short film The Adventures of André & Wally B.",0
4217,"In the next few years, a designer suggested naming a new digital compositing computer the ""Picture Maker"".",0
4218,"Smith suggested that the laser-based device have a catchier name, and came up with ""Pixer"", which after a meeting was changed to ""Pixar"".In 1982, the team began working on special-effects film sequences with Industrial Light & Magic.",0
4219,"After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith.",0
4220,"Among the 38 remaining employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, Ralph Guggenheim, and Bill Reeves, who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT.",0
4221,"Tom Duff, also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation.",0
4222,"With Lucas' 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi, they knew he would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group.",0
4223,"Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer-animated movie, they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was to turn the group into an independent company.",0
4224,"But Moore's Law also said that the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper product while waiting for computers to become powerful enough.",0
4225,"Eventually, they decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime, with their Pixar Image Computer as the core product, a system primarily sold to government agencies and the scientific and medical community.",0
4226,They also used SGI computers.,0
4227,"In 1983, Nolan Bushnell founded a new computer-guided animation studio called Kadabrascope as a subsidiary of his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company (PTT), which was founded in 1977.",0
4228,"Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas special for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots; known as ""Chuck E. Cheese: The Christmas That Almost Wasn't"".",0
4229,The animation movement would be made using tweening instead of traditional cel animation.,0
4230,"After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat.",0
4231,"Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) was sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm.",0
4232,The Kadabrascope assets were combined with the Computer Division of Lucasfilm.,0
4233,"Coincidentally, one of Steve Jobs's first jobs was under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT.",0
4234,PTT would later go bankrupt in 1984 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.,0
4235,The newly independent Pixar (1986) was headed by Edwin Catmull as President and Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President.,0
4236,"While looking for investors, Steve Jobs showed interest, but initially, Lucas found his offer too low.",0
4237,Yet he eventually accepted after it turned out to be impossible to find other investors.,0
4238,At that point Smith and Catmull had been turned down 45 times; thirty-five venture capitalists and 10 large corporations had declined.,0
4239,"Jobs, who had recently been fired from Apple, and was now founder and CEO of the new computer company NeXT.",0
4240,"On February 3, 1986, he paid $5  million of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights and invested $5 million cash as capital into the company, joining the board of directors as chairman.In 1985, while still at Lucasfilm, they had made a deal with the Japanese publisher Shogakukan to make a computer-animated movie called Monkey, based on the Monkey King.",0
4241,"The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in 1986, but in the end, it became clear that the technology was simply not there yet.",0
4242,The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high.,0
4243,"So it was decided to focus on the computer hardware business some more years while waiting until Moore's law made a computer-animated feature possible.At the time Walt Disney Studios was interested and eventually bought and used the Pixar Image Computer and custom software written by Pixar as part of their Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) project, to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method.",0
4244,"In a bid to drive sales of the system and increase the company's capital, Jobs suggested to make the system available to mainstream users and released the product to the market.",0
4245,"Pixar employee John Lasseter, who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr. (1986) to show off the device's capabilities, premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.However, the Image Computer never sold well.",0
4246,Inadequate sales threatened to put the company out of business as financial losses grew.,0
4247,"Jobs invested more and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50 million gave him control of the entire company.",0
4248,"In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), was turned into a division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies.",0
4249,"In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees.",0
4250,"That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California.",0
4251,Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems.,0
4252,"RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream add depth.",0
4253,"During this period, Pixar continued its successful relationship with Walt Disney Animation Studios, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner.",0
4254,"As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced the total number of employees to just 42, essentially its original number.",0
4255,"Yet Pixar made a historic $26 million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story, a concept which was the product of the technological limitations CGI struggled with at the time.",0
4256,"By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.Despite the total income from these projects, the company continued to lose money and Jobs, as chairman of the board and now the full owner, often considered selling it.",0
4257,"Even as late as 1994, Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison.",0
4258,Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story would probably be a hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance.,0
4259,"For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO.",0
4260,"Toy Story went on to gross more than $373 million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year.",0
4261,"In only its first half-hour of trading, Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of unmatched buy orders.",0
4262,"Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar gradually developed the ""Pixar Braintrust,"" the studio's primary creative development process, in which all directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other's projects on a regular basis and give each other very candid ""notes"" (the industry term for constructive criticism).",0
4263,"The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a ""filmmaker-driven studio,"" in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like peer review, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an ""executive-driven studio"" in which directors are micromanaged through ""mandatory notes"" from development executives ranking above the producers.",0
4264,"According to Catmull, it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter, Stanton, Docter, Unkrich, and Joe Ranft on Toy Story.As a result of the success of Toy Story, Pixar built a new studio at the Emeryville campus which was designed by PWP Landscape Architecture and opened in November 2000.",0
4265,Pixar and Disney had disagreements over the production of Toy Story 2.,0
4266,"Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production.",0
4267,"Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused.",0
4268,"Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable.",0
4269,"Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution.",0
4270,"Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story, character and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee.",0
4271,"The lack of story, character and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement for ten months before it fell through in January 2004.",0
4272,"The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting story, character and sequel rights themselves while Disney would own the right of first refusal to distribute any sequels.",0
4273,"Pixar also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10- to 15-percent distribution fee.",0
4274,"More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006).",0
4275,"Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been.",0
4276,"They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.",0
4277,"Despite this announcement and several talks with Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, and 20th Century Fox, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN, ""We would love to be in business with Pixar.",0
4278,"They are a great company.""",0
4279,"After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005.",0
4280,"In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months.",0
4281,This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season.,0
4282,"An added benefit of delaying Cars from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, to see how things would play out between the two companies.Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels.",0
4283,"In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was meant to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee.",0
4284,"The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.",0
4285,"In January 2006, Disney ultimately agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal.",0
4286,"Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition was completed January 25, 2006.",0
4287,"The transaction catapulted Jobs, who owned 49.65% of total share interest in Pixar, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7%, valued at $3.9 billion, and a new seat on its board of directors.",0
4288,"Jobs's new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares.",0
4289,Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.,0
4290,"As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became Chief Creative Officer (reporting directly to President and CEO Robert Iger and consulting with Disney Director Roy E. Disney) of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios (including its division DisneyToon Studios), as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks.",0
4291,"Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios.",0
4292,"Jobs's position as Pixar's chairman and chief executive officer was abolished, and instead, he took a place on the Disney board of directors.After the deal closed in January 2006, Lasseter revealed that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade at the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005.",0
4293,"Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar.",0
4294,"Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information to the board of directors at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar.",0
4295,"Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.",0
4296,"Lasseter and Catmull's oversight of both the Disney Feature Animation and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging, however.",0
4297,"In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal.",0
4298,"Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the lack of employment contracts.",0
4299,"Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville, California, location with the ""Pixar"" sign.",0
4300,"Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be ""Disney•Pixar"" (beginning with Cars).Jim Morris, producer of WALL-E (2008), became general manager of Pixar.",0
4301,"In this new position, Morris took charge of the day-to-day running of the studio facilities and products.After a few years, Lasseter and Catmull were able to successfully transfer the basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust to Disney Animation Studio, although meetings of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly ""more polite"" than those of the Pixar Braintrust.",0
4302,"Catmull later explained that after the merger, to maintain the studios' separate identities and cultures (notwithstanding the fact of common ownership and common senior management), he and Lasseter ""drew a hard line"" that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.",0
4303,"That rule ensures that each studio maintains ""local ownership"" of projects and can be proud of its own work.",0
4304,"Thus, for example, when Pixar had issues with Ratatouille and Disney Animation had issues with Bolt (2008), ""nobody bailed them out"" and each studio was required ""to solve the problem on its own"" even when they knew there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.In November 2014, Morris was promoted to president of Pixar, while his counterpart at Disney Animation, general manager Andrew Millstein, was also promoted to president of that studio.",0
4305,"Both continue to report to Catmull, who retains the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar.On November 21, 2017, Lasseter announced that he was taking a six-month leave of absence after acknowledging what he called ""missteps"" in his behavior with employees in a memo to staff.",0
4306,"According to The Hollywood Reporter and The Washington Post, Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees.",0
4307,"On June 8, 2018, it was announced that Lasseter would leave Disney Animation and Pixar at the end of the year, but would take on a consulting role until then.",0
4308,"Pete Docter was announced as Lasseter's replacement as chief creative officer of Pixar on June 19, 2018.On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Catmull would be retiring.",0
4309,He stayed in an adviser role until July 2019.,0
4310,"On January 18, 2019, it was announced that Lee Unkrich would be leaving Pixar after 25 years.",0
4311,"On April 20, 2010, Pixar opened Pixar Canada in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",0
4312,"The roughly 2,000 square meters studio produced seven short films based on Toy Story and Cars characters.",0
4313,"In October 2013, the studio was closed down to refocus Pixar's efforts at its main headquarters.",0
4314,"When Steve Jobs, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. and Pixar, and John Lasseter, then-executive vice president of Pixar, decided to move their studios from a leased space in Point Richmond, California, to larger quarters of their own, they chose a 20-acre site in Emeryville, California, formerly occupied by Del Monte Foods, Inc.",0
4315,"The first building of several, a high-tech structure designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, has special foundations and generators to ensure continued film production, even through major earthquakes.",0

4317,The two-story steel-and-masonry building is a collaborative space with many pathways.,0
4318,"The digital revolution in filmmaking was driven by applied mathematics, including computational physics and geometry.",0
4319,"In 2008, this led Pixar senior scientist Tony DeRose to offer to host the second Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at the Emeryville campus.",0
4320,"While some of Pixar's first animators were former cel animators including John Lasseter, they also came from computer animation or were fresh college graduates.",0
4321,"A large number of animators that make up the animation department at Pixar were hired around the time the studio released A Bug's Life (1998), Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003).",0
4322,"Although Toy Story was a successful film, it was Pixar's first feature film at the time, becoming the first major computer-animation studio to successfully produce theatrical feature films.",0
4323,The majority of the animation industry was (and still is) located in Los Angeles while Pixar is located 350 miles (560 km) north in the San Francisco Bay Area.,0
4324,"Also, traditional hand-drawn animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.",0
4325,"With the scarcity of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north to give up traditional animation and try computer animation, Pixar's new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation.",0
4326,"For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.In an interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley, Lasseter said that Pixar's films follow the same theme of self-improvement as the company itself has: with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family.",0
4327,"At the core, Lasseter said, ""it's gotta be about the growth of the main character and how he changes.",0
4328,"""As of 2020, every Pixar feature film has included a character voiced by John Ratzenberger, who had famously starred in the TV show Cheers.",0

4330,"After the third scene, Mack (his character in Cars) realizes that the same actor has been voicing characters in every film.",0
4331,"Due to the traditions that have occurred within the films and shorts such as anthropomorphic creatures and objects as well as easter egg crossovers between films and shorts that have been spotted by Pixar fans, a blog post entitled The Pixar Theory was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni proposing that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related.",0

4335,"Following the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement despite their own right to do so.",0
4336,"After the two companies were unable to agree on a new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan to move forward on sequels with/without Pixar and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney's then-new CGI division Circle 7 Animation.",0
